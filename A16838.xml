            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

There was a great controuerſie betwen him and Anſelme, concerning the inuestiture of Biſhops, and geuing of benefices. This Anſelme condemned the lawful mariage of prieſtes, and conſtrayned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to forſake their wyues. He accuſed alſo the King at Rome before Paſchalis the ſecond, who was then Byſhop of Rome, becauſe the King had made and ordained certaine Byſhops and Abbotes in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And one VVilliam VVarluuaſte being the Kinges Proctor and Clarke, aunſwearing for the Kinges ryght amonge other thinges ſayd boldely, that the King woulde not for the loſſe of his kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, loſe the prerogatyue of the inueſtiture of hys Byſhops. Vnto the whiche Pope Paſchalis aunſwered full proudlye. If (as thou ſayeſt) thy King will not ſuffer the donation of Churches to bee alienate from him, for the loſſe of hys kingdome, know thou (flatlye and playnely, I ſpeake it before God) I would not ſuffer him quietly to enioy them for the price of his hedde (O proud Sathan.) VVhich talke being finiſhed, Anſelmus deſyred the Pope, that he hauyng no regard to the King, would depoſe the ſayd Byſhoppes, whiche thyng when it came to the Kinges eares, he did confiſcate Anſelmus goodes, and depriued hym of hys Byſhoprike. Notwithſtandyng as ſome write, the King reſtored Anſelmus agayn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> excile and banyſhment.

Thys prelates name was Cadolus Byſhop of Parma, who with a mighty hoſt of men beſieged Rome, but after one or two battailes foughte, he was put to flight. Henry the Emperour to take awaye this ſciſme, ſent thether with his authoritye, one Otho Archbiſhop of Colyne,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7195:8"/> who commyng to Rome, made and ſayd very muche of the Emperours ſyde, for the election of the Pope, and dyd greatlye blame and accuſe Alexander for that he was elected without the Emperoures conſent.

                  <p>In his Prologue alſo vpon the Prouerbes of Salomon, after he had ſpoken of the booke of wiſedome, whiche is ſayde to be Salomons, and of the booke called <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> he addeth this.

                  <p>This Hierome coulde not be ignoraunt of the Decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Carthage, for (as many do write) he dyed aboute the yeare of our Lorde <hi>.422,</hi> and therefore it is to be iudged, that ſaint Auſten ment no otherwiſe, but as Hierome did, that is, that he nombred the ſeconde booke of the Machabees among the Canonicall, but yet vnderſtoode it to be Eccleſiaſticall, that is not of ſo great aucthoritie, as the bookes, which of olde antiquitie were counpted Canonicall.</p>
                  <p>Ruffinus in the expoſition of the Apoſtles Symbole, doth recite no more bokes of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but ſo many as are rehearſed before, &amp; amonge other thynges theſe be his wordes. <hi>Hec ſunt veteris Teſtamenti volumina que ſecundum maiorum traditionem, per ipſum ſpiritum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum inſpirata creduntur, &amp; Eccleſiis Chriſti tradita ſunt.

                  <p>Finally, the fact and dede of Raſias, recorded in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d boke, is not greatly commended of certeyne learned and godly men, bycauſe he in a maner killed him ſelfe, alſo in the ende of the booke it is written: <hi>Si bene ſcripſi, eſt quod volui: Sin exiliter, eſt quod potui.</hi> If I haue written wel, it is that, that I woulde: If I haue written ſclenderly, it is that which I could.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Thens was a noble citie where all liberall ſciences were taught, it is called the mother of all Philoſophers, all Greece had not in it a more beautifull and nobler thing. The ſituation thereof was very ſpectable and pleaſaunt. It was alſo as it were a certaine mother ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and refuge, into the which all other cities nere adioygning, (afflicted and preſt with terrors of warre or any other calamities) did flie &amp; had recourſe. It was a moſt ſafe and ſure receptacle of all ſhippes, mariners and Marchauntes. It was the nobleſt vniuerſitie of all the worlde, and none in times paſt was coumpted learned, which had not geuen dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to learning at Athens. Strabo writeth that there was in Athens a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine rocke ſet in a plaine, which was inhabited rounde about circle wiſe. In that plaine was the temple of Minerua, and in that temple there was an image, whiche the inhabitantes did beleue to haue fallen from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the ſayd Churche there was a perpetuall fire with a companie of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. This citie was called alſo Cecropia, of a certaine kyng named Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crops, and Mopſopia of one Mopſus, as of Ianus the ſonne of Iaphet, was named (as ſome write) Ionia, At the laſt this citie was called of this word Minerua, Athens, for the Grecians do call Minerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Athena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And Minerua the virgine founde out Clothemakyng, VVeauyng and Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and manye other Artificiall things. And therfore ſhe was taken as a famous goddeſſe. And bycauſe all her inuentions did procede out of the
<pb facs="tcp:7195:13"/> quicknes of wit and greate wiſedome, the Poetes do fable that ſhe was borne of Iupiters brayne.</p>
               <p>As Cecrops was repairing and fortifieng the citie of Athens, water broke fourth ſodenly in a certaine place, and in an other place there was founde an Oliue tree, vpon the which wonders, Apollo being demaunded at Delphos, what was ment therby, and what were beſt to be done, made aunſwere: that the Oliue tree did ſignifie Mineruam, and the water dyd betoken Neptunum, and that they both were ſiſters children, and both Gods, and that it was in the arbitrement of the citezens, to call the citie after one of their two names. So (al the citizens beyng aſſembled) the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did cleue and conſent to Neptunus, the women vnto Minerua: who obtei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned that the citie ſhould be called by the name of Minerua. The Poets do ſay that Neptunus and Minerua did builde the citie of Athens, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was altercation betwen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the impoſition of the name, (other Gods being preſent,) they conuented betwene them ſelues, that whether of them (ſmityng the ground) ſhould bring fourth the moſt laudable and worthy effect, ſhould name the citie. Neptunus ſmiting the ground with his mace, brought fourth an borſe, an inſtrument of war, but Minerua throwing her ſpeare vpon the ground, brought fourth an Oliue tree, of peace &amp; quietnes, which bicauſe it was cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted more profitable by their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the city was called by her name, Athens. Therfore the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were not ſtraungers, nor a rablement of people gathered together which gaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> originall of the citie, but they wer borne in the ſame grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wher they dwelt. They firſt taught y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of Clothemaking, and of Oyle, they taught the maner to Ploughe and to ſowe Corne, vnto them whiche before did eate Acornes. Learning, Eloquence, and al ciuill order of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline did floriſhe at Athens.</p>
               <p>Cecrops alſo made .iij. lawes againſt their wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to pacifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ire of Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunus, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did ſet behind Minerua. The firſt law was that no woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould euer enter into the Senate, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d law was, that no child ſhould be called by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mothers name. And the third was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man ſhould call them <hi>Mulieres Athenienſes,</hi> but <hi>Atticas.</hi> There be three prouerbes which had their originall of Athens. The firſte prouerbe is this: <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſium inconſulta temeritas:</hi> the vnaduiſed raſhenes of the Athenians, It may be applyed agaynſt them whoſe raſh conſultation cometh to good ſucceſſe. For in tymes paſte it was commonly imputed to the Athenians, that they would ſlackelye conſulte for their affaires, and had litle fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, or no prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in their doinges. But Minerua Lady Preſident of the citie did accuſtome to turne their ill purpoſes to a good end.</p>
               <p>The like prouerbe is at this tyme in euery mans mouth: <hi>Eſt fortunati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or quam prudentior.</hi> It is better to be happy, then wiſe. It may be ſpoken
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7195:13"/> of hym whiche hath good ſucceſſe and chaunce, not by hys induſtrie and wiſedome, but by commoditie of fortune.</p>

                  <p>The originall of this prouerbe ſprang of this, bycauſe that at Athens there was a Churche builded vnto the Lady faith. Velleius Paterculus maketh mention of this in theſe wordes: If any do impute to the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that time of rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the whiche Athens was taken of Silla, truly he is ignoraunt of al truth and antiquitie. For the faith of the Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, was ſo certaine &amp; ſure toward the Romanes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alwayes and in al things what ſoeuer was done w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſincere and vncorrupt fidelitie, the Romanes would pronounce that to be don <hi>Attica fide,</hi> by the faith of the Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>

His mothers name was Monica, &amp; his father was of the order of Senators. They were verye honeſt perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but yet of no hie nor rich degree, his brothers name was Nauigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. He was of ſuch excellent wit, that in his childhood he learned all the ſeuen liberal ſciences, without any inſtructor. He was wonderfully lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſpecially in the doctrine of Plato. His maiſters name was Manlius Theodorus. He hated the Greeke toung, and was in great loue with the Latine toung. In his youth beyng ſixtene yeares of age, he was greatlye geuen to fleſhly luſtes, and by the reaſon of ill companye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted theft.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7195:15"/> About the age of .xix. yeares (his father being dead two yeares before) chaunſed vpon the booke of Cicero called Hortenſius, and being moued thereby, fel to the ſtudy of philoſophy. He ſomwhat applied his minde to the holy ſcriptures, but for the ſimplicity of the ſtile he did lothe them. He being of the age of .xx. yeares, by himſelfe did read the Catagories of Ariſtotle, and vnderſtode them, &amp; was expert in al the Mathematical ſciences. A litle after he chaunced vpon the Manichies, and did embrace and receiue their opinions.</p>
               <p>And by the ſpace of ix. yeares, that is from .xix. vntil he came to the age of .xxviij. he did perſiſt in the ſame hereſye, and diſceaued manye. He vſed the vnlawful companye and bed of one Concubine. At the age of .xxix: he heard one Festus a Manachie reade at Carthage, whom at the firſt he prayſed aboue all other: but when by conference and diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, he perceaued him to be ignorant of the liberal ſciences, and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pert in nothing but grammar: he diſpeired that he mought be taught by the Manichies of the truth, which to attaine he much deſired. At the laſt he went to Rome, agaynſt his mothers wyll, who pitifully lamented the ſame: wher he profeſſed Rhetorick, hoping that he ſhould find ther more obedient and more thankful diſciples. And ther he fel ſick of a feuer, &amp; was in great daunger, but he recouered his health, and vſed ſtil the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Manichies, but did not ſo much defend their doctrine, bicauſe after the opinion of the Academickes he iudged all things to be doubted of. And being forſaken of his ingrate diſciples, went vnto Millen, where he was fatherly receaued of ſaint Ambroſe, whom he alſo loued agayne, not for true doctrines ſake, but onely for his benificence. He heard Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe diligently, not for the deſire of the knowledge of truth, but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would proue whether Ambroſe were of the ſame eloquence as he was reported to be. At the laſt he became neither a Manichy nor a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, but doubted how the way of life and ſaluation mought be found out, his mother came to Millen vnto him, hoping her ſonne to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſaynt Ambroſe.</p>
               <p>VVhen he was .xxx. yeares of age, he maried a wyfe, and was betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vnto her, but ſhe was not mariageable by twoo yeares, and he was faine to exſpect and tary for her ſo long. VVhen his Concubine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode that he minded to mary a wife, ſhe departed from him into Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, and left him a ſonne, which he had by her, and then he tooke an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Concubine. At the laſt he came to one Simplicianus, and did vtter and open vnto him al the circumſtances of his errours, and deſired coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of him, how he might come to a more perfect and fuller knowledge of the truth, who did exhort and counſel him to reade the holy ſcriptures,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:16"/> and to follow the example of Victorinus, who with the diligent reading of them, became a Chriſtian, and profeſsing openly his fayth, was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Auſten being very deſirous to follow the ſame example, his mynde was drawen hether and thether what he might do, and by chaunce one Pontinianus did recite vnto him the hiſtory of Antonius, and of other two, which readyng the booke of Antonie (forſaking al their goods &amp; their wiues) embraced the monaſtical life. VVith the which narration, Auſten being greatly moued, lamented his life, and departing into a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with his friend Alippius, fel to pouring out aboundaunce of teares, and deſired God to giue him a more pure minde and better life. And ther he heard as it were out of the next houſe, a voice of children or maidens, ſinging and ſaying: <hi>Tolle, lege, Tolle, lege,</hi> take and read, take &amp; reade. But when he ſaw no perſon, he thought it to be Gods admonition and warning. And then taking the booke of the new teſtament, chaunced vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place of Paule. <hi>Induite dominum noſtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſum Chriſtum, et car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nis prouidentiam ne feceritis in concupiſcentiis.</hi> Put vpon you our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and make not prouiſion for the fleſh in concupiſcence and luſte. After he had red theſe woordes, all darknes and ignorance were ſhaken from his eyes, ſo that he ſaw the truth, and imparting this to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippius, they both purpoſed to embrace Chriſtes riligion: not without the great comfort and ioy of his mother Monica, who al the time that he was a Manichie, both dayly and moſt earneſtly prayed to God for his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In the meane time, he was greatly tormented with the tooth ache, but by the praiers of his brethren he was miraculouſlye healed. At the laſt he renounced the profeſsion of Rhetoricke, by the reaſon that he was ſhort winded, and pained in his ſtomache, and gaue his minde wholy to the reading of the holy ſcriptures. He wrote to ſaint Ambroſe, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and confeſsing vnto him al his errors, and ſheweth what he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do, and aſketh counſell what bokes of the holy bible he ought chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reade. Ambroſe perſwaded him to read the prophet Eſay, but when it ſeemed ſomwhat hard vnto him, he deferred the readyng therof vnto an other time. About y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feaſt of Eaſter, he was baptized at Millen, with Alippius his friend, and his natural ſonne Adeodatus, which was of the age of .xv yeares. After his conuerſion, he led a moſt godly and vertuous life. He wrote notable and worthy workes, he was very liberal and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to the poore. He kept no company with women, for auoiding of ſuſpition. His apparel was neither to coſtly nor to baſe, but of an honeſt and comely ſorte. His table was not ſumptuous, but frugall and honeſt, hauing fleſh for ſtraungers ſakes, and for them which were diſeaſed. At his meales he did more regard reading and diſputing, then eating or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7195:16"/> drinking. He was very harberous, and kept a good houſe. He moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſtly hated detractions, and ill reportes of ſuche as wer abſent, and had written vpon his table theſe two verſes.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe two brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, two peoples are ſignified. In the yonger are ſignified the elect people of God, and eſpecially of the Gentiles. In the elder are ſignified reprobates, and ſpeciallye of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites. Nor yet two peoples onelye are ſignified by them, but alſo the chiefe heades of them. VVherefore Abel is the tipe and figure of Chriſt which is the elect of all electes. And on the other ſide Cain is the tipe &amp; figure of Antechriſt, which is the reprobate of all reprobates. The elect, I ſay, are noted in Abel, bicauſe he is counted the firſt iuſt man, not by the righteouſnes of nature, law, and fleſh, but by the righteouſnes of grace, faith, and the ſpirit. He is iuſt by the righteouſnes of Chriſt, of whom he was partaker through the ſpirite, no otherwiſe then as the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers are partakers of the influence of the head: and as the riuer is of the exundant flowing of the ſpring. For Chriſt is not onely full of grace and righteouſnes, but is ful of the original iuſtice, and capital grace, that al perſons may draw therof.</p>
                  <p>And wher it was ſaid before that in Abel wer ſignified the elect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſpecially of the Gentiles: that was ſpoken partly bicauſe he is the yonger, and partly bicauſe his name is Abel.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt it doth playnly appeare that the Gentiles were younger then the Hebrues, for the Hebrues had their original being of Sem, which was Noes eldeſt ſonne, and the Gentiles came of Iaphet, a younger ſonne of his. They were younger I ſaye, not onelye in nature, but alſo in fayth, for as much as God did firſt open him ſelfe vnto the Iewes, and ſhewed them away how they ſhould worſhip him.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, Abel doth ſignify vayne, which doth well agree vnto the Gentiles, both before they were conuerted, and after they wer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7195:17"/> but yet in a diuers reſpect. Before they were conuerted, not onely bicauſe they were Athei, that is, knowing no God, vncertayne, vayne, ſwelling in their euil thoughtes, worſhipping idols, being without hope, without promiſe, without teſtament and couenantes, but alſo bicauſe God made none accompt of them, but as one ſuffring them to folow their own luſtes and wayes, yea and regarding them not onelye not to be hys people, but as though they were no people, as the Apoſtle Paule doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times record.</p>
                  <p>Nowe after they were conuerted, they were likewiſe vaine, but yet in an other ſenſe. For when the moſt higheſt began to call thoſe thinges which were not, euen as thoſe thinges which were, and after it pleaſed him to make a people not his, to be his people: and after he had opened their eyes, and had ſurrogate them in the place of the Iſraelites, and made them his members: yet they were compted vayne, partly, bicauſe ſuch is the peoples iudgement of Gods elect, compting their life madnes, and their end without honour: partly, bicauſe they which be elect, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly taught by Gods ſpirite, that there is nothing firme and ſure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſunne, but that all thinges are vanity, and affliction of the ſpirit, and ſpecially that the life of man is nothing els but a vapour, and that man is nothing els but Bulla, a buble of the water. The elect I ſay, being thus perſwaded, do litle regard thinges temporal: nor greatlye paſſe for them ſelues, nor do truſt to their own good woorkes, but deny them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, hating their own life, and coumpting all thinges filthynes, which are without Chriſt, as Paule ſayth to the Philippians.</p>
                  <p>In Cain (as is ſayd before) the reprohates are ſignified,<note place="margin">Philip. 3.</note> bycauſe he is coumpted the firſt wycked man, the reprobate I ſay, ſpeciallye of the Hebrues, and that partly bicauſe he was the elder brother, and partlye bicauſe his name is interpreted poſſeſsion. The Hebrues did greatlye flatter them ſelues, and boaſted them ſelues to be the peculiar people of God, they were puft vp with incredible pride, and dyd perſwade them ſelues, that the whole world pertayned to them, bycauſe they dwelled in the chiefe and beſt place thereof.

                        <hi>Tradare Satanae,</hi> to giue ouer vnto Satan, is diuerſly and many waies expounded of the learned. Some expound it <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> to be nothyng els but to be excommunicate, that is, to be excluded and ſhut out of the Church, in the which when Chriſt doth obtaine the kingdome, and the Deuil without the church doth play the tirant, it doth followe, that all they which are caſt from the church, by the diſcipline of excemmunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are made the bondſlaues of Satan.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7195:28"/>
                     <p>Therfore bicauſe we are receaued into the fellowſhip of the church, vpon this condicion, that we ſhould remaine ſtil in the faith, and vnder the gouernment of Chriſt, we do ſay him which is out of the church, to be deliuered vnto the power of Satan, bicauſe he is a ſtraunger and a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain from the houſhold of God, for without the church ther is no ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Other expound, <hi>Tradere Satanae,</hi> to pertaine to ſome notable ſcourge or plague, wherby the deuil ſhould afflict and vexe the perſon exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, as the Apoſtle Paule in his Epiſtle to Timothe doth teſtify, that he did ſo vnto Alexander and Himeneus, that they ſhoulde learne not to blaſpheme.</p>
                     <p>And ſo God doth worke together with the iudgement of the church, when he doth decree and appoint by the rule of holy ſcriptures, to ſende tormentes and vncleane ſpirites, to vexe them that be excommunicate. VVe reade, that when ſaint Ambroſe had excommunicate the Scribe of one Stillico, the Scribe was moſt greuouſly vexed of an euil ſpirite, and this God doth, that he might declare that thing to be ratefied in heauen, which is iuſtly done in earth by his Church. Chriſoſtome and other doo write, the great power of God to be declared by ſome miracle, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is deliuered vnto Satan.</p>
                     <p>But of what great efficacy and ſtrength the power to deliuer to Satan is, and how much it ought to be feared, let vs call to remembrance the examples of Moſes,<note place="margin">4. Regum. 2. Actes. 5. Actes. 13.</note> againſt the Chorites, of Helias, and of Helize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, agaynſt the falſe Prophetes, and agaynſt the chyldren whych were torne of the Beares.

                     <p>It is a very greuous thyng, if a man weyghe it well, to bee baniſhed and caſt out of a Citye, that is wealthye, and well inſtitute and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: howe muche more greuous is it to be baniſhed oute of the Churche, whiche is the chiefe Citye and common wealth of Chriſt? Howe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye (thyncke you) dyd it vexe the godlye Emperour Theodoſius, when he deepelye lamented, bycauſe he was excommunicate of Saynct Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe?</p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:7195:28"/>
                     <p>And although the church in this our time cannot deliuer them that fall and are excommunicate, vnto Satan, to be afflicted and vexed in body, yet God himſelfe doth often execute it with ſeuerity. Paule writing to the Corinthians ſaith, that many of you be ſicke and weake,<note place="margin">1.

The end therfore of excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is to procure the health and amendement of them that do ſo fal, they are not to be counted and taken as enemies.</p>
                     <p>Therfore Paule ſaith to the Theſſalonians:<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 3.</note>

                     <p>Now a word or two of certaine degrees which were vſed in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue Churche, concerning excommunication, and who they be that ought to be excommunicate.</p>
                     <p>Saint Ciprian maketh mencion of certain which wer called Abſtenti, which are reſtrained and put back for a certain time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>
                     <p>Other were called Excommunicati, who as yet tooke no repentance, and vnto theſe likewyſe were the ſacramentes forbidden, but not for a preſcribed time, as vnto them which were named Abſtenti.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſome were called Anathematizati, who were deſperate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and without ſhame or feare, either of God or man.</p>
                     <p>Chriſoſtome doth write an homely of this kinde of curſe, called Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, wherin he ſheweth that neither the liuing nor the dead ought to be puniſhed with that kinde of paine, for we ought alwayes to hope the beſt of them which be yet liuing. As for the dead they be alreadye at the iudgement ſeate of God.</p>
                     <p>Doctrine, ſaith Chriſoſtome, and not men, ought to be ſtriken Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themate. But this doth not agre with the ſayinges of other Fathers, or with the ſentence of general counſels, yea it ſeemeth alſo contrary to the holy ſcriptures, for Paule, Galath. <hi>1.</hi> writeth thus: If an aungell of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preach any other doctrine then we preach, <hi>Anathema ſit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Nicen Sinode, there appeare certayn decrees to be eſtabliſhed in the church. In the firſt place were <hi>Audientes,</hi> who were permitted to be preſent at ſermons, from which none were reſtrained, vnles he were a derider, and deſpiſer of Gods word.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ther were <hi>Procumbentes,</hi> which dyd aſke forgiuenes of the miniſters of the church.</p>
                     <p>Thirdlye, there were <hi>Orantes,</hi> who although they were reſtrayned from the Sacraments, yet they were ſuffred to be preſent at prayers.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and finally, were <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municantes,</hi> which were preſent both at ſermons, at prayers, and at the receauing of the ſacramentes.</p>
                     <p>But many do thinke theſe thinges to be forged, and ſo to be put into the ſayd counſel, as lawful decrees.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding it may be gathered out of faint Ciprian, that there were certaine degrees of ſuch as did fall. They (ſaith he) which fel to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, were not receaued againe of the church, before the houre of death. Adulterers and fornicators were receaued after long repentance.

                        <p>Monarchia is the rule and gouernment, pertaining onely to one man, as to a King, a Queene, or a Prince of a realme.</p>

I aſke thee therfore, whether thou beleue, thou ſayeſt, I do beleue: do then that thou ſayeſt, and thou dooſt beleue.</p>
                     <p>I do read in an olde Pamphiliona pretie rule concerning this worde (Fides.) And although ſuch Pamphelions (for the moſt parte) do ſauer groſſe &amp; ſuperſticious doctrine, yet ſometime they ſpeake truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitably, as the common prouerbe runneth. <hi>Sepe etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt holitor valde op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuna locutus.</hi> The gardiner ſomtimes ſpeaketh apt &amp; meete things. One demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of Virgill, what he did with Ennius workes in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, who made anſwere: <hi>Ex ſtercore Ennii auru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> colligo.</hi> I gather golde out of Ennius doung. So one may gather out of barbarous writers, ſome profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table leſſons. The rule concerning faith is this. That Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith (ſaith he) may be accepted of God, it ought to be perfect, according to the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fication

                     <p>Chriſoſtome likewiſe doth diſſent from them, which doo thinke that Paule doth make mencion of his wife in the Epiſtle to the Philippians, but he ſheweth no reaſon why he doth diſſent: but whether (I pray you) ſhould we geue credite to Ambroſe and Chriſoſtome, and other whyche were ſo long a ſpace after Paule, or els to Clement and Ignatius, the one being ſaint Peter his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſciple of ſaint Marke? The ſtature of Paul is deſcribed of Nicephorus: he had a litle body, crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and ſomwhat bowing, aſmal head, a white face, bearing ſome age in it, his eyebrowes hanging downward, a long noſe, but comelye bowed, a thick &amp; a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g berd, &amp; white hore heares, aſwel in his buſh as in his berd.</p>
                     <p>At the laſt he was beheaded of the moſt filthy and cruell tirant Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, the ſame yeare and daye that Peter was hanged on a croſſe, that is the <hi>.14.</hi> yeare of the raigne of Nero, which was after the death of Chriſt <hi>37.</hi> yere, as Hierome, Euſebius, and other do write. But the authour of the booke of the life of Paule, which is falſly aſcribed vnto one Abdias, doth ſay that Paul was ſlaine two yere after the death of Peter.</p>
                     <p>Of the cauſe of his death, the auncient writers make no record, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it were generally for the fayth and confeſsion of Ieſus Chriſt. Yet Chriſoſtome Lib. <hi>2.

                     </p>
                     <p>That is: Paule alluring vnto the faith a certaine harlot, whom Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro did inordinately loue, and made very much of, did perſwade her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the ſacrament of Chriſtes religion, &amp; likewiſe to decline &amp; leaue the filthy and fleſhly copulation. Nero calling Paul a corrupter, a knaue &amp; a wicked ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did firſt caſt him into priſon, and after that did require him to ceaſe to geue any ſuch counſel or perſwacions vnto the young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which thing when he coulde not obtaine of Paule, he cauſed that moſt holy man and apoſtle to be ſlayne.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, it is taken ſpecially for one of the foure cardinal vertues, wherof ſaint Ambroſe writing in his firſt booke <hi>De officiis</hi> ſayth: <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia eſt quae dat cuilibet, quod ſuum eſt, nihil vendicans alienum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There be foure cardinal vertues, wiſdome, fortitude, temperaunce, &amp; iuſtice: of all the which ſaint Auſten writeth in lib <hi>14 de trinitate. ca. 9</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>That is to ſay: Iuſtice doth helpe and ayd the weake, and them that be in miſery, wiſdome doth take hede before hand of diſceit, or any other in conuenience, fortitude doth ſuffer ſtrongly al griefes and hardnes, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraunce doth reſtraine wanton pleaſures and luſtes.</p>
                     <p>They be called cardinall vertues, bicauſe they be the chiefe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues political, and in them doth depend the whole life of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ciuil man.

                     </p>
                     <p>The other vertues called <hi>Virtutes theologicae,</hi> be three in number: that is, faith, hope, and charity, and they differ from the cardinall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in ſundry pointes: for the theologicall vertues, do pertaine to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions and motions, the cardinal vertues pertaine to externe and outward workes and dedes. The theological vertues tend vnto God, the cardinal vertues vnto our outward neighbours and dealing. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To end, <hi>Iuſtitia</hi> ſpecially is as Cicero writeth <hi>De legibus, obtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio ſcriptis legibus inſtitutiſque populorum,</hi> that is: It is an obedience geuen to lawes written, and to the ordinances and decrees of the people,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:41"/> and concerning this ſignification we haue twoo notable examples, for the preſeruing of law and equity. Valerius Maximus doth record of one Seleucus, who did defend and gouerne the city of the Locretians wyth moſt wholſome and profitable lawes, of the which this was one, that who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoeuer committed adultery, ſhould by a ſtatute made by him, leeſe both his eyes. It ſo chaunced that his own ſonne was taken firſt with the ſame fact and fault, and was condemned according to the law, to ſuſtaine the paine that was inflicted to adulterers, but the whole city, for honour of the father, requeſted Seleucus to remit the payne vnto his ſonne, but he for a certaine time gaue them repulſe. At the laſt Seleucus being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with requeſtes and deſires of the people, cauſed one of his own eyes firſt to be put out, and afterward one of his ſonnes eyes, &amp; ſo leauing the vſe of ſight vnto them both, did according vnto equity and preſcription of the law, take that due puniſhment which the lawe appointed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterers, and ſo, wyth a goodly temperature, did ſhew him ſelfe both to be a mercyfull father, and a righteous iudge.</p>
                     <p>The other examples, Nicephorus doth reherſe of Traianus the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who gouerning the Romane Empire, was ſo ſtudious of conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing iuſtice and good order, that he did geue, in the ſight of all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, aſword drawen to the ruler of the city, ſaying after this manner. <hi>Cape ferrum hoc, &amp; ſiquidem recte imperium geſſero, pro me, ſin aliter, contra me hoc vtere.</hi> That is to ſay.

                     <p>This was ſpoken againſt the Phariſeis, Scribes, and the diſciples of Iohn, and not to be imputed to the diſciples of Chriſt, neither yet to hys doctrine, nor vnto Ieſu hymſelfe.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7195:43"/> the duke to take to wife Helena, the doughter of king Coil, which was a wonderful fayre mayden, and therwith wel learned. This Conſtantius when he had recouered the tribute, returned with hys wife Helena to Rome, as chief gouernour of Britaine, and at the laſt died at Yorke Yet Iulius Firmicus doth record, that Conſtantine was borne of Helena, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a concubine, and begotten at Tharſus.

                     <p>This Conſtantine became a noble and valiant Prince, and ſo mighty in martial proweſſe, that he was ſurnamed the great Conſtantine. He was firſt an idolatrour, and by the impulſion of his wyfe Fauſta, did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto idols. But after he had vanquiſhed Maxentius, he vtterlye renounced the worſhipping of idols, and became a chriſtian man.

In wytnes of hys beliefe, he cauſed a booke of the Goſpels to be caryed before him, and made the Bible to be copied out, and ſent into all partes of his Empire.</p>

                     <p>He was baptized of Euſebius, Biſhop of Nicomedia, and ſhortlye after ended his life in the ſame citye, and was buried at Conſtantinople.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding Iacobus Philippus in ſupplemento Cronicorum, that Conſtantine was chriſtened of Pope Silueſter the firſt. He writeth alſo, that for the great ſlaughter of Martirs, and for the tormenting of people innumerable through his prouinces, God ſtroke him with a kinde of leproſy, the which could not be cured nor holpen by his phiſicions, nor any other learned men, but the Prieſtes of the Capitol of Rome, gaue this counſell, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a certayn pond ſhould be filled with the bloud of yong chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the emperour to waſh &amp; hath himſelf in it being hot, &amp; ſo ſhuld recouer his helth.

<pb facs="tcp:7195:44"/> Hieronimus, Ruffinus, Croſius, and other do ſufficiently teſtifie. For all theſe, writing moſt copiouſlye, amply, and largely of hys lyfe, do make no mention of this leproſie: but certayne late wryters doo rehearſe it out of an Apocriphall booke, wrytten of thinges done by Silueſter. Alſo how true it is that Helena after ſhe had found the croſſe, did build a temple ther in that place, and from thence went to Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople vnto her ſonne, and brought with her the. <hi>3.</hi> nailes wherwith Chriſt was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, of the which, Conſtantine put one in his horſe bridle, which he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed onely in Battel, and did ſet the ſecond in his helmet, and threwe the third into the ſea called <hi>Mare Adriaticum,</hi> to appeaſe the tempeſtuous rages of the ſea.

                     </p>
                     <p>Yet I am not ignoraunt, that ſaint Ambroſe writeth almoſt the like in his funerall oration, of the death of Theodotius the Emperour. But Eraſmus writeth that the orations, the Epiſtles, and ſermons which are contained in the thirde tome, be foreged &amp; fained in S.

                     <p>Againe, that Conſtantine was baptiſed at Rome, of Silueſter, it is a very lye. For Euſebius. lib. <hi>4.</hi> of the life of Conſtantine, doth affirme that he was chriſtened a litle before his death, in an aſſemblye of Biſhoppes, at Nicomedia, of one Euſebius, biſhop of that place. And ſaint Hierome declareth no leſſe in his cronicle, &amp; ſayth, that this was done in the thre ſcore &amp; fift yeare of his age, and the .xxxi. yeare of his Empire, when Silueſter was dead almoſt fiue yeares before, as Ruffinus, Theodoretus, and other do record in their hiſtories.</p>
                     <p>Iſidorus in his cronicle doth write, that Conſtantine was rebaptized of Euſebius, being an Arrian: but Socrates and other more auncient &amp; better approued authours, do affirme him to haue bene baptized, but ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer rebaptiſed. And the Arimine counſell, in their letters to Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius doth teſtifie, that Conſtantine embracing the true fayth of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen counſell, and being baptiſed, departed from this preſent life.</p>
                     <p>I omit here the ſaying of Gracianus, who writeth that Melchiades baptiſed Conſtantine, when Melchiades was before Silueſter his time, and Conſtantine was baptiſed after the death of them both.</p>
                     <p>I omit alſo Nicephorum, who affirmed that the Arrians throughe a diueliſh mynde, did faine that Conſtantine was baptiſed at Nicomedia, and he iudgeth that he was baptiſed at Rome of Silueſter, and that Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine made at Rome <hi>Baptiſteriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is, a Fonte, or a place to chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in.

For the ſenate of Rome and the greateſt part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of Rome, were moſt ſtraunge from the Chriſtian religion, not onely in the tyme of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, but alſo in the reigne of Valentinian, whiche reigned almoſt xl. yeare after Conſtantine. And therfore if he would haue graunted this donation vnto Silueſter, neither his own ſonnes, neither his frendes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his kinſfolke, nor the ſenate of Rome, would haue ſuffred him ſo to do: yea his faith and his owne conſcience would not haue led him to the ſame, for being learned in the holy ſcriptures, he did know that a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate was the ordinaunce of God, and that the offices of the Miniſters of the Church, and of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall Magiſtrate, were two diſtinct things, and that they ought not to be confounded and mingled, as he him ſelfe was wonte to ſay, as Euſebius writeth: <hi>Deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſacerdotibus commiſiſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam Eccleſiae cura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſibi vero externa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is to ſai, God did commit the inward cure of the Church vnto Prieſts, &amp; the outward cure vnto him.</p>

                        <p>Do you beleue, that Peter the Apoſtle would haue receiued the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power with the Empire, if the Emperour Nero had offred it hym? no truly. Before Peter receaued the holy ghoſt, he being diſceaued with other of the Iewes, did imagine, that the kingdome of Chriſt ſhould be a terreſtriall kyngdome, but after he had receiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt, he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the kingdome and ſeate of Chriſt not to be ſet in earth, but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and that his kingdome was not of this world. He knew, that Christ did flee into the deſerte, when the people went about to make him kyng. He knew how Elizeus did refuſe the donation and offer of Naman the prince, and how that Geezi his ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for requiring and receyuing the ſame, was ſtriken with a fowle leoprie. Peter would not take vpon him the cure and care ouer the poore, leaſt he ſhould be hindered both to pray
<pb facs="tcp:7195:45"/> and preach as often as he ſhould. As the acte of the Apoſtles doth teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. And I beſech you, is it like then, that Peter would caſt of his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and receaue vpon him the gouernment of the whole world? He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth that one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can conueniently Miniſter the word, &amp; alſo Miniſter to the tables. And what Pope can they geue vs, which had a better and a more ample ſpirite, then Peter had, whiche could perfourme that thyng which Peter could not? Therfore they be but toyes and trifles, which are written of the donation of Conſtantine.</p>
                        <p>Conſtantine was more ſound in religion, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to purpoſe ſuch a grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which he knew to repugne vtterly agaynſt the doctrine of Chriſt.

                        <p>Thirdly, the Biſhops the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues did not thinck the iudgement of their cauſes to pertaine to the examination of the Biſhops of Rome, but they iudged the power and iuriſdiction of the Emperour, to be moſt auctenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ouer them, and therfore they brought their cauſes vnto him.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, it doth manifeſtly appeare out of the hiſtories, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour did exerciſe power and auctoritie ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhops, as other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours did, which ſucceded him. He did not onely iudge of euery one of them, if they had offended, but alſo did vſe his power ouer all that were ſubiect vnto his Empire, compelling them by his edict and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come to the generall counſell, preſcribyng vnto them both tyme and place.</p>
                        <p>VVhen the fathers were aſſembled at Tirus, they did declare vnto Conſtantine the names of them which wer abſent, whom they deſired to be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ſo he wrote to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ſhuld come to the counſell, and ſhould adioyne their care and ſtudie with the other in the ſayd counſell: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded alſo his Ambaſſadour, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould put to exile and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all them which did either refuſe to come, or els did litle eſteme the commaundement of the counſell.</p>
                        <p>Alſo when the ſayd Conſtantine vnderſtood, that Athanaſius was wrongfully condemned in the counſell holden at Tirus, he ſent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeuere and ſharpe letters, in the which he commaundeth all thoſe fathers to come vnto him to Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople, and there to declare before him, how purely and truly they had iudged: and doth openly obiect vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they went about nothing els, but thoſe thinges which did tende to diſſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, debate, hatred, and the ſubuerſion of mankind.</p>
                        <p>Athanaſius alſo himſelfe being conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned at Tirus, did flee vnto Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine. Saint Auſten alſo writeth, that Donatus being condempned in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel Arelatine, did appeale vnto Conſtantine: which hearyng both the parties, did iuſtifie and pronounce Cecilianus to be innocent.</p>
                        <p>Euſebius doth teſtifie, that Conſtantine did confirme the definitions
<pb facs="tcp:7195:46"/> of the Biſhops concluded in the counſels, and did commaunde the rulers of the people, that none ſhould infring nor breake thoſe thinges whiche were decreed of the Biſhops. Alſo he embraced the decrees of the Nicene counſell, and did proteſt, that he would baniſh all thoſe which would not ſubſcribe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which alſo he did, for he ſent Arrius with a .xi. of his fellowes into exile, and commaunded the bokes of Arrius to be burnt. And if any man had bene taken to haue kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either priuatly or apert<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, he commaunded him to be put to death.</p>
                        <p>By theſe examples ye may ſee, that Conſtantine did not giue ouer his aucthoritie and power vnto the Biſhops, but did both intermeddle with ſpiritual matters to rule and iudge biſhops, yea and cal general cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels: and not onely he, but alſo his ſucceſſors did call by their auctoritie and power, Biſhops and fathers vnto counſels.</p>
                        <p>Leo the Pope, firſt of that name, with his whole ſinode gathered at Rome, moſt humbly deſired the Emperour Theodoſius, that he would commaunde a generall counſell to be celebrated and kept in Italie. And yet the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Emperour did not appoint the counſell, in Italie, where there was no contention riſen, but in Grecia in the Citie called Sedon.</p>

                        <p>Alſo in the Epiſtle of Pope Agatho, ſent to the Emperour, by whoſe commaundement the ſixt counſell was called and gathered together, ye may read after this maner: <hi>Ideoque Chriſtianiſsimi dn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>i, ſecundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priſsi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miſsionem ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuetudinis veſtrae, pro obedientia qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> debemus preſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes famulos noſtros miſimꝰ,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay.

                        <p>Note here (good reader) this clauſe, <hi>Pro obedientia qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> debemus</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience which we do owe, wil the Pope acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto the emperours maieſtie? will he acknowledge the iuriſdiction and power of emperours to be ouer Biſhops? no, no, his Antichriſtian pride will not ſuffer him.</p>
                        <p>VVhich of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhops of Rome did gouerne the Apoſtolicke Church with a greater care &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, then Gregory the great? &amp; yet he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng <hi>Ad Theodorum</hi> the Phiſition, ſayth of the Emperour <hi>Mauricius,</hi> as followeth: <hi>Valde autem mihi durum videtur, vt ab eius ſeruitio milites ſuos prohibear, qui ei &amp; omnia tribuit, &amp; dominare eum no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum militibus, ſed &amp; ſacerdotibus conceſsit,</hi> that is to ſay: it ſemeth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard thyng, that he ſhould forbid hys ſoldiours from his homage and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7195:46"/> ſeruice, whiche hath both giuen to him all thinges, and alſo hath graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to haue dominion &amp; rule, not onely ouer the ſouldiours, but alſo ouer the Prieſts. Againe in the ende of the Epiſtle which he wrote to the Emperour himſelfe, he ſayth thus: <hi>Que debui, exolui, qui &amp; imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri obedientiam prebui, et pro deo, quod ſenſi minime tacui,</hi> that is: I paid thoſe thinges that I ought, which haue giuen both mine obedience to the Emperours, and alſo haue not holde my peace in Gods cauſe, but ſpake y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche I thought. Do you not here ſee that this Gregory being Pope, did not onely obey the Emperour, but alſo did acknowledge that he ought to ſhew obedience vnto him, And will his ſucceſſors and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clergie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſort, plucke their neckes out of the yoke of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which by Gods law is due vnto Magiſtrates, but ye may ſee, to what diſorder pryde and ambition hath driuen the Biſhops of Rome.</p>
                        <p>One Auguſtinus Stenchus, is not aſhamed to write, that the Biſhop of Rome was called a God, &amp; coumpted for a God, and ſaith, that this was done when the Emperour did beautifie him with a noble title, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him as God, and as the ſucceſſor of Chriſt and Peter, and gaue hym godly honor, and did reuerence him, as the liuely image of Chriſt. This writeth the ſame Stenchus ſexione. Lib. <hi>67.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>O intollerable blaſphemie, O vnſpeakable knauerie, O moſt ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deuiliſh flatterie, cleane repugnant to the moſt ſacred and holy word of God. VVhat did Peter I pray you, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cornelius did fall down, and would haue worſhipped him? did he not lift him vp and ſay, <hi>Surge,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Act. 10.</note>

And will the Pope be better then Peter? hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier then Iohn? well he may take an example of Herodes Agrippa, which gaue eare vnto the flattering voyces of the people, which cried, <hi>Vox dei non hominis.</hi> It is the voyce of God, and not of man.<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> He did not ſtay the people, but tooke a glory in their wordes, and therfore was ſtriken of the aungell, and like a wretch did rot, beyng eaten of Lice. It behoueth vs to know, that Chriſt the ſonne of god doth reigne yet in his Church, as chief head and ruler, vnto whom onely and alone, all glory and power is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and not to thincke, that he did ſubſtitute any man, in whom he would be worſhipped, for Chriſt onely ought they to worſhip, honor, and to pray vnto. And as for the Pope and all his ſacrilegious flatterers, we ought to deteſt and abhorre as the very Antichrist. To conclude, ſome writers do recorde, that when Conſtantine gaue riches and honor vnto the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:47"/> there was a voyce heard, which ſaid, <hi>Iam venenum irrepſit in eccleſiam,</hi> now is poiſon crepte into the Churche, he that will know more of the life of Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine, let him read the v. bookes of <hi>Euſebius Ceſarienſis,</hi> whiche he purpoſly wrote of the ſame.</p>

Although they beleued <hi>In genere,</hi> certeine chief pointes of doctrine, as God to be but one God, and Meſsias to come, and to bring great benefites with him, and the ſoules after the death of the bodies to be immortall, yet had they certeine horrible ſpots, and prophane and wicked opinions in many articles of the heauenly doctrine. They were moſt cruell and bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto Chriſt and his diſciples: And (as Hierome ſayth) they conſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to the death of Iohn the Baptiſt.

VVhiche were diſcrepant from true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, they ſwarued from them. They did alſo abhorre the groſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Epicuriſime of the Saduces.

And that they might the better bring to paſſe the thing whiche they did attempte, they went into the vttermoſt coſte of Iurie, to a certain lake, named Asphaltites, not far from Ierico, where there were moſt fragrant and ſwete orchardes of baulme, as Plinie writeth of them: Ioſephus <hi>De bello Iudaico,</hi> writeth thus of them as foloweth.</p>

After that, they go euery one vnto their worke and buſines, and after they haue wrought to the fifth houre, they congregate them ſelues together agayne. And then being girte with linnen clothes, waſh their bodies with cold water.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7195:48"/> And being ſo purified, they came into their ſupping, or dining chamber, and when euerie man is ſet with ſilence, the baker doth ſet a loſe to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one in order, and the cooke in likewiſe doth giue to euery one a diſhe of potage. And before they eate, the Prieſt doth call vpon God with his prayer, and likewiſe when diner is done, doth rendre thanckes, and then they put of thoſe holy veſtementes, and go agayne to worke vnto the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng. VVhen they diſpute, they come together, no leſſe then a hundred, and whatſoeuer is decreed of them, ſtandeth immouable, and not to be chaunged. Yf any man blaſpheme God, they condempne him to death. To ſpit before them, or on the right ſide of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they do greatlye abhorre. On the Saboth day, they be very ſcrupulous and ſuperſtitious to do any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worke, in ſo much that they will not kyndle the fier that day, nor cary any veſſell, no nor go to the ſtoole to eaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. In other dayes, they digge a pit of a foote deepe, and couering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with a long gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do eaſe themſelues in the ſame pit. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue done, couer it agayne with the ſame earth, and this thyng among them is counted very ſolemne. Their opinion is, that the bodyes be corruptible, and the matter of them is not perpetual, but they beleue the ſoules to be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and do ſay, that the good ſoules ſhall lyue beyond the Occean ſea, where they ſhall haue their fruition and pleaſure. For they thincke, that that region is not ſubiect to heate, colde, ſhowers, or tempeſtes, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſaunt and delectable. The ill ſoules ſhalbe ſent (ſaye they) to tempeſtuous and colde places, full of mournyng and payne without end.

                     <p>VVhen notwithstandyng theſe Epiſtles do not ſeeme to be the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of thoſe holy men, if the contentes and circumſtances of them be duely conſidered, for it is written in the Epiſtles of Clement, howe he was Pope, and the ſucceſſor of Peter, and that he ſent theſe Epiſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of Peter, to ſaint Iames, which was called the brother of the Lord, and was Biſhop of Hieruſalem, but this is vtterly falſe, for it is manifeſt, that Iames finiſhed his life with martyrdome eight yeares before Peter. He writeth alſo, that Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was the ſucceſſor of Peter, but this is red alſo in other thinges, which are aſcribed vnto Anaclete. But if this ſhould be true, how do theſe holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Hierome, Auſten, Opta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tus, Mileuitanus and other whiche do write the cataloge and order of all the Biſhops of Rome, not knowe this? VVhich do not ſet in Clement, or at the leaſt, do not put him immediatly after Peter, if they had then either ſeene the Epiſtles, or counted them auctentycall. Furthermore there is founde in the ſame Epiſtles, the difference of Biſhoppes from Prieſtes, whiche notwithſtanding began long after in the Churche after Clement, as it pleaſeth Hierome and Damaſus.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo the authoritie of moſt auncient and great learned wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whiche do declare, that theſe Biſhoppes of Rome ſhould not be the authors of theſe Epiſtles. For neyther Hierome, nor Damaſus, nor Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, nor the ſixte counſell of Carthage, doo make any mention of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7195:49"/> Epiſtles, nor ye ſhall finde theſe Epiſtles to be cited of any author wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy credit, vnto the tyme of Carolus Magnus. And it is not vnlike to be true, that about that tyme, when the VVeſt Churches did aſke &amp; ſeeke bookes out of the Librarie of Rome, that theſe Epiſtles were feyned, for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged, and diſperſed abroad by the fraude &amp; craft of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhops of Rome, whiche then did affecte Empire and rule, not onely ouer all Churches, but alſo aboue kynges and princes of the earth.</p>
                     <p>But to (come to our purpoſe agayne) Monckerie began about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng of the foure hundred yeares after Chriſt, and that in Egypt, where Antonius, Macarius, Panubus and Paulus, floriſhed in that kind of life, and likewiſe in other places of the world, as Sozomenus doth teſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie. And truly it is maruell, when that age had ſo great learned men, that they did not onely approue, but alſo inſtitute and ordeine thoſe kindes of life, which were not institute, nor ordeined of God. Sozomenus doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, that there were two kindes of Monckes: the one, whiche liued in the wildernes: the other, which liued in cities, but yet ſeparate from the companie of other men. The maner of a monaſticall life, Baſilius doth rehearſe, and ſhewe, <hi>In ſermone Aſcetico,</hi> out of the which it appeareth, that they whiche profeſſed Monckerie, did firſt geue all their goods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went into the monaſterie: his wordes be theſe. <hi>Oportet mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum ante omnia id vitae genus amplecti, vt nihil poſsideat, corpus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat quietum, &amp; habitum honeſtum, vocem moderatam, &amp; ſermonem bene diſpoſitum, cibum ac potum ſumere tranquille, ac cum ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio, apud ſeniores tacere,</hi> that is to ſay:</p>
                     <p>It behoueth a Moncke aboue all thinges, to embrace that kinde of life, that he poſſeſſe nothyng, that he haue a quiet body, an honeſt habite, a moderate voyce, communication well diſpoſed and ordered, that he take his meat and drincke quietly and with ſilence, that among his Seniors and elders, he hold his peace.

                        <p>Of this name there were nine cities, one in Beotia, an other in Egipt, the third in Theſſalia, the fourth in Cilicia, the fift in Iouia, the ſixt in Attica, the ſeuenth in Cataonia, the eyght in Italy, the ninth in Syria.</p>

It had an hundred gates, and in euerye gate were two hundred kepers, which excelled in great horſes and chariotes, vnder the which ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty kings were wont to bring forth great and huge hoſtes of armed men, none of the citizens perceauing it.</p>
                        <p>There was in this city (ſayth Calliniachus) a caue, which being at all other times full of wynde, yet in that ſpace, which is betwene the olde Moone and the new, which is called in latine <hi>interlunium,</hi> there was no ayre perceaued at all.</p>

                        <p>The furlong was firſt inuented of Hercules, and he met it at Piſis, where Iupiter Olimpius was. The length of that ſame furlong, was two hundred feete, wherupon ſome inuented after, other kindes of furlongs in Grece, being likewiſe of twoo hundred feete of length, yet ſomewhat ſhorter then Hercules furlong.

                        <p>Stadium properly containeth the eight part of a myle, and before the Romanes found out their miles, men did diuide and meaſure the ſpaces of the earth by furlongs.</p>
                        <p>But the Perſians dyd vſe a furlong, but an other kinde of meaſure, which they cal <hi>Paraſangam,</hi> which conteineth the ſpace of ſixe myles &amp;

                        <p>I would God that the princes, and noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the earth with others, would heare and conſider theſe thinges, and ſpecially they which would purchaſe vnto them ſelues perpetual renowme, with ſuch outragious &amp; fond buildinges. For what is more fond, then to waſt and ſpend out of meaſure much riches in vnprofitable buildings, that ſhall do good to no
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7195:53"/> man? And here by the way, I wiſh the Clergie and the people would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend with them ſelues, what they do, which diſpoſe ſo prepoſterouſly &amp; vainly, the reuenues and yearely profites of the Churches (I meane in building of great and ſumptuous temples) with ſpires ſo high and long, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be almoſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pyramides of Egipt.

That the poore and oppreſſed with calamities, ought to be relieued and maintayned with the goods of the church, the old cuſtome and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the primitiue church doth teach and declare. VVhich you may eaſely perceaue, partly out of other mens writings, and ſpecially out of epiſtles of the holy martyr ſaint Ciprian, writing chiefly of a certain ſcof<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer to be excommunicated, vnles he would leaue his arte and facultye. His woords be theſe. <hi>Quod ſi penuriam talis, &amp; neceſſitatem pauperta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis obtendit, poteſt inter caeteros, qui alimentis eccleſiae ſuſtinentur, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius quoque neceſsitas adiuuari: ſi tamen contentus ſit frugalioribus &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nocentibus cibis.</hi> If ſuch a one do make a pretence of penury &amp; lacke his neceſsity among other, which ar ſuſtained with the goods of the church, may be eaſed and holpen, ſo that he be contented with ſober and meane diet. And a litle after in the ſame epiſtle he writeth of the ſame perſon, af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter this maner. <hi>Quod ſi (inquit) illic eccleſia non ſufficit vt laborantibus praeſtentur alimenta, poterit ſe ad nos tranſferre, &amp; hic, quod ſibi ad vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum atque veſtitum neceſſarium fuerit, accipere.</hi> If the church (ſaith he) ther, be not able or ſufficient to geue nouriſhment to ſuch as labour, and haue neede, he may come hether vnto vs, and here receaue that which ſhal be neceſſary vnto him, both for meate, drinke, and cloth. By thys place of Ciprian you may coniecture, that the needy and miſerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, did not onely make their refuge vnto the liberality of the Churche, wher they dwelt, but alſo that one church did communicate her riches vnto other Churches, in the nouriſhing of the poore, according to the moſt Chriſtian inſtitution of Saint Paule.</p>
                        <p>Neyther for any other cauſe did Baſilius Magnus, or other of lyke pietye, builde hoſpitales for poore wayfaring men, and houſes for beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and ſycke men, but that they myght eaſe wyth their priuate expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the common charges of the Churche, whiche at that tyme was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye poore.</p>
                        <p>If any man be of a contrary iudgement, and will prefer the exceſsiue
<pb facs="tcp:7195:54"/> riches of the church, before the neceſsitye of the poore, let him conſider (whatſoeuer he be) what ſaint Ambroſe a noble father &amp; doctor of the church doth write to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. His words be theſe in his boke of offices <hi>Aurum eccleſia habet, non vt ſeruet, ſed vt eroget: vt ſubueniat in neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitatibus. Quid opus eſt cuſtodire quod nihil adiuuat? An ignoramus quantum auri atque argenti de templo domini, Aſſyrii ſuſtulerint?

                        </p>
                        <p>That is to ſay: The church hath gold, not to keepe, but to beſtow it, and to helpe men in their neceſsity. VVhat nedeth to keepe that whych helpeth nothing? Are we ignorant how much gold and ſiluer, the Aſsiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tooke away out of the temple of the Lord? VVere it not better that the Prieſtes ſhould beſtow it to the ſuſtentation of the poore (if other ſuccours lacke) then that it ſhould be caried away by the ſacrilege of the enemy? VVill not the Lord ſay: why didſt thou ſuffer ſo many poore men to dye for hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger? And yet truly, thou hadſt gold wherwith to relieue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. VVhy are there ſo many caried away captiue, by the entercourſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundiſe, and not redemed? VVhy are ther ſo many ſlaine of the enemy? It were better that the veſſels of the liuing were preſerued, then the veſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſels of mettal. Vnto this ther can be no anſwer made. For what wouldeſt thou ſay? I feared, leaſt there ſhould lacke to decke the temple of God withall. He would anſwere: Holy things doo not require gold, neither thoſe things can be made acceptable by gold, which cannot be bought with gold. The ornament of the ſacraments, is the redemption of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. And thoſe are truly precious veſſels, which redeeme the ſoules from death. That is, the true treaſure of the Lord, that doth worke that, which the Lordes bloud wrought. And a little after he ſayth. <hi>Laurentius, qui aurum eccleſiae maluit erogare pauperibus, quam perſecutori reſeruare, pro ſingulari ſuae interpretationis viuacitate, ſacram Martyrii accepit co ronam.</hi> Saint Laurence, which had leauer to diſtribute the gold of the churche to the needye, then leaue them to the perſecutour, for his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler and liuely interpretacion, receiued the bleſſed crowne of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. VVas it ſayd (thinke you) to ſaynt Laurence, thou oughteſt not to do away the treaſures of the church, and ſel the holy veſſels? To what vſes the veſſels of the Churche are to be diſpoſed, or after what ſorte, or for what cauſes, it is needefull onely that thou conſider this with a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7195:54"/> pure faith, and a prouident iudgement. Truly if a man employ them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity, it is a fault, but if he beſtow them vpon the poore, it is a deede of mercy. For no man can ſay why do the poore liue? No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can complaine, bicauſe the captiue are redemed. <hi>Haec Ambroſius.</hi> The which wordes of Ambroſe, for this cauſe I haue alledged, that it might be vnderſtoode, vpon what vſes chiefly, the eccleſiaſticall goods ought to to be beſtowed. Yea, and to ſpeake freely the truth, the priuate money of the chriſtians pertaineth to none other vſe, if any man haue more then is ſufficient for the maintenance of his life. It is not to be reproued nor diſalowed (after the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) if any do build temples, beutifiyng them with marbel and gold, ſo that it be not done to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity of other, but the care and regard of the poore is to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a great deale better, then all ſuch thinges, yea ſo much, that if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do the other without this, he may be iudged rather to offend, then to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit. For God is not ſo much delighted, with dead temples made of ſtone, as he is with liuely temples, made of fleſh and bone. VVherupon Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome both nobly and notably (as he doth all thinges) writeth vpon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, after this maner <hi>Tu ſi praeparaſſe quoſdam vaſa videris ſacra, aut ornatum quem piam alium circa parietes eccleſiarum, acpauimenta con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feciſſe, nolito reprihendere, aut iubere vt vendatur quod iam factum eſt, ne animum eius qui fecit, perturbes.

For the redemption of the ſoule of man, are his owne riches. VVhich thing we ſee many to doo, which oppreſſe by might their Clientes, the poore, and huſband men of the country (that I maye not ſpeake of the violence of warriers and Iudges) and commyt robbery and theft, that of much, they may geue a litle to the poore, boaſting and gloriyng in their wyckednes.

                        <p>I haue brought in ſaynt Ierome for this purpoſe, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, the cuſtome of offering in the Churches, to be verye auncient, but at this time to be greatly abuſed, the Paſtours and Miniſters challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it wholy vnto them ſelues, what ſo euer is offered in the Church. By what right, and how lawfully, let them take heede. But yet notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I doubt not, but that in ſhort ſpace, all pouertye and beggerye wyll be expelled out of the commonwealth, if this cuſtome were renued and had in vre againe.</p>
                        <p>But (to returne from whence we haue gone aſtraye) I thincke it is made euident inough, that it is not lawfull for Chriſtians ſo vaynelye to caſt away vpon earthly, bridge, and baren woorkes, the riches, due one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto the poore, whether they be of the Churche, or prophane ryches. For ther is nothing more meete, then that the members of Chriſt ſhould be relieued with Chriſtes money. Ther is nothing more decent and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, then that a Chriſtian man, what ſoeuer riches he poſſeſſeth, more then neceſſary, that he reſtore them vnto Chriſt, the geuer of all riches and goodnes.</p>

For whatſoeuer we doo vnto the poore, it is accompted and taken, as thoughe we did it vnto Chriſt beyng preſent. All our lyfe is nothing but a temptacion, and therefore it hath neede of Gods diuine counſell and helpe.</p>

For in this onelye thing chiefly riche men excel, bicauſe they haue a great occaſion to helpe other. It is meete therfore, that they in their good deedes, agree and anſwer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the goodnes and benignity of God, and that they beſtowe their goodes geuen them by God, not vpon high turrets and mighty images, not vpon towers and caſtels, but in nouriſhing, clothing and defending of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes body, which is the church.

                     <p>THree hundred and ſixe yeares after Chriſt, Diocleſian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne his moſt fierce &amp; cruel perſecution againſt the church of Chriſt. Euſebius writeth, that ther was no perſecution ſo cruel and bloudy, neither before nor after. He ioyned wyth him in the Empire, one Herculius Maximianus, a cruel, a fierce, and an vnfaithful man, and yet a foole, and a lecherous man. The ſeate of the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perours at that time which ruled, was in Nicomedia. VVhen Diocleſian was there, he ſhot out fires and flames, as it were out of the moſt fierce and burning hill Aetna, and there, by chaunce the Emperours palace was burnt, the which by and by certaine malicious enemies did laye to the Chriſten mens charge, and did exaſperate and kindle the Emperour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and ſo began his perſecution, and foorthwith commaunded all the temples of the Chriſtians, to be throwne downe flat to the ground through the whole Empire, which they did moſt diſpitefully, euen vpon Eaſter day. And afterward commaunded all the bookes of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures to be burned, which they did in the market place.</p>
                     <p>Eutropius writeth, that Diocleſian, would be woorſhipped as God, and commaunded that men falling downe flat to the ground, ſhould kys his feete. Of this Tirant tooke the Pope of Rome example, who offered his feete likewiſe to be kiſſed, yea of Princes and Emperours. He raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned .xx. yeares, and gaue ouer the Empire at Nicomedia, and liued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a priuate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, alledging for his excuſe, the great waight &amp; charge that an Emperour had, &amp; alledged alſo his age. But as Nicepborus wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth, he confeſſed vnto his frendes, that he did it of a certaine deſperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe he could not extinguiſh nor deſtroy the religion of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſaw the noble and conſtant mindes of the martirs, which dyed ſo valiantly in the quarel of their maſter Chriſt. Afterward, as Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us writeth, he fel into a diſeaſe, wherwith he dyed miſerably.</p>
                     <p>Ruffinus doth write, that he was firſt afflicted with diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry diſeaſes, and at the laſt fell into a conſumption, and ſo into a frenſy, wherwith being taken, he deſtroyed himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Nicephorus ſaith, that Diocleſian being ſmitten of God with diuers plages, had firſt in his body a great ſwelling, which being broken in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, did ſo conſume away by title and litle, that his moſt wycked &amp; blaſphemous toung, which had vomited out ſuch blaſphemies againſt the moſt high God, did gendre wormes within the iawes: which wormes creeping out of his mouth, did infect all the place where he abode, wyth moſt filthy ſtincke, and at the laſt barking like a dog, gaue vp his wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and damnable lyfe with great violence.</p>

                     <p>Euſebius writeth, that in the time of the perſecution vnder Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, he ſaw with his eyes, that beaſts moſt fierce and cruell, (as Beares, Libardes, Bulles and ſuch like,) vnto whom the Martirs were throwne to be deſtroyed, although they were ſturred with famine and fire vnto furie, yet they would not come to the Martirs.

                     <p>Nicephorus doth adde and ſaye, that a certaine Bulle did licke the feete of a Martir with his tounge, and ſo departed from him, as it were with a certaine reuerence and feare.</p>

They haue great and ſtronge legges, not hauing one whole bone onely (as certeine vnexpert writers do thinke and declare,) but they bow the knee as other foure footed beaſtes do. And as <hi>Aloiſius Cadamuſtus</hi> writeth, they fall downe on their knees, and receiue certeine vpon their backes, and ſo riſe agayne. They haue a taile like to an Oxe, very thinne ſet with heare, ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they cannot well defende them ſelues from the iniurie and byting of flies, but nature hath giuen them another defence, for their ſkinne is cancelled and wrinckled, whiche they contracte or draw together, and ſo kill the flies. They hurte no man, except they be prouoked and ſtyrred to anger, but if they be moued, they take the man with their longe noſe, and throwe him vp ſo hie, that before he fall to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground agayne, he is choked &amp; dieth. Furthermore there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſwift of foote neither in going nor running, but that the Olepha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, not running but going his paſe, will ouertake, the reaſon is, bycauſe of their mightie body and long legs. They do feede on the bowghes and fruite of trees, and there is no tree ſo great, but that the Olephant will breake him, throwe him downe, and teare him with his <hi>Promuſside,</hi> that is his lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g noſe. They grow to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hight of ſixtene handfulles, therfore they whiche are not wonte to go vp vpon them, are affected with lothſomnes euen as they whiche be not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to arriue in the ſeas. They can ſuffer no bridle nor halter vpon their heades, therfore they go looſe and at libertie with their heades, but they do greatly obey their gouernours, they vnderſtand their ſpeache and are eaſily ruled with their wordes. They do feare fire ſo greatly, that if they once ſee it, they runne away, and cannot be called againe. The Olepha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes do not couple them ſelues together, nor gender before they be of the age of .xx yeares, as Ariſtotle writeth in his booke <hi>De hiſtoria animalium.</hi> VVherin the error of Plinie is manifeſtly ſeene, which wrote, that the Male Oliphant doth ioyne him ſelf to the Female at the age of .v. yeares, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Female doth bring forth at the age of .x. yeres. The Olipha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes abhorre adulterie, for euery Male Oliphant, doth vſe the company onely of one Female. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe is great, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Male toucheth her no more. How long tyme the Female doth go with her young, it is not knowne, bycauſe beyng ſtriken with a certeine ſhame; they neuer couple together, but in a ſecret and priuie place. Therefore ſome do appoynte vnto them one yeare and a halfe, ſome two yeares, other three yeares. The Females
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7195:58"/> bring fourth their young with great dolour and paine, they licke their young with their mouth, whiche aſſoone as it is brought forth, doth both ſee and go.</p>
                     <p>Ariſtole ſayth, how ſome thincke, that Oliphantes liue two hundred yeres, but are moſt luſtie at the age of threſcore, they can ſuffer no cold, nor abide the hard winter. They haue great delight to be about riuers and floudes, whiche they go into after the maner of Oxen and Kie. They ſeme to ſhew a certaine religion in them, for they worſhip the ſunne and moone, as the inhabitantes of Mauritania, can declare. For in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions there be innumerable, which when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moone is newe and doth ſhine, doo go in a great companie together into the riuers, and there waſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, and when they be waſhed, kneling on their knees, they ſalute the moone, and ſo returne into the woodes. Some doo ſay, they be ſo quicke of vnderſtanding, that when they ſhould paſſe ouer the ſeas to other regi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons, they will not go into the ſhippes, before they which lead them do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with an oth to returne againe. VVhen they go into the woodes, they go alwayes in a great flocke together, the oldeſt of them leadyng and going before, the next of age comming behind and driuing them. Some write that when they be hunted, perceiuing that the praye which men ſeeke of them, is onelye in their teeth, they ſtrike them with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence into the trees, and ſo pull them out, but this is as vayne and falſe, as the beaſt called Fiber, doth bite of his ſtones when he is hunted. The Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes are by nature very wilde and vntameable, but they are made milde and gentle by arte and pollicie as many other beaſtes be. If they be litle and yong, they are made tame by other Olipha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, which are already tame, if they be put among them. But Plinie writeth, that the great ones are tamed by honger and ſtripes. The teth of the Oliphantes are of a mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uelous bignes, and are ſolde in many cities of Italie, as at Rome, Venice, Millein, and Naples, of the which teeth are made not onely combes, but many other inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to the vſe of man: This Iuery is very good for the white diſeaſe of women, if it be beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into moſt fine pouder, if it be dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke with the iuice of the ſeede of Lectuice beyng laid in water, in the whiche ſteele hath bene quenched.

Ariſtotle ſaith, that ſome Oliphantes doo drinke Oile, ſome do not, and they which drinke Oile (if there be any Iron in their bellie) it is drawen out by the drinking therof and ſome do drinke wine. And when they cannot drincke it, then they make medicines with Oyle, and ſo geue it them to drincke.</p>

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:7195:62"/>
                  <p>It is therfore a new inuention and lye, inuented lately in the diuels ſhoppe, that all doctrine of religion cannot be proued out of the ſcriptures, and that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s traditions without the beſides the ſcriptures, are neceſſary workes to ſaluation. The Church in Cirils time knew no ſuch kinde of blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>Saynt Auſten writeth the like vpon the ſame place. <hi>Cum dominus Ieſus inquit multa ſigna feciſſet, non omnia ſcripta ſunt, electa enim ſunt quae ſcriberentur, quae credentium ſaluti ſufficere videbantur.</hi> When our Lord Ieſus (ſaith he) had done many miracles, all were not written, but theſe thinges were choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which were thought ſufficient for the ſaluacion of the beleuing.</p>

In the third chapter he writeth thus. This ſecond epiſtle I write vnto you, beloued, wherwith I ſtyrre vp and warne your pure mindes, to call to remembraunce the woordes which were told before of the holy Prophets, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the commaundement of vs the Apoſtles of the Lord and ſauiour.

                     <p>The Iewes for that they haue in reuerence, and doe yet obſerue and kepe circumciſion and other Moſaicall ceremonies, with new rites of their own inuention.

                     <p>To take away from the ſcriptures, is when we make voyde the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God through our own traditions, as for example: where God commaundeth the Parents to be honoured and relieued, we thinke it better to caſt our money into Corban, and to beſtow it vpon pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, images, lightes, banner clothes, &amp; ſuch other trumpery.

Truly it is like that one of them hath ſene that reuelation which is caryed about in the name of Iohn. But if we geue credit vnto them whiche came before Euſebius (as Iuſtinus, Tetullianus, Ireneus, Appollonius, Theophilus, Antiochenus, &amp; other,) it may be affirmed, that it was the very worke of Iohn the apoſtle. For why ſhould theſe men ſo conſtantly confirme it to be the booke of Iohn the apoſtle, if they had knowen any doubtful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of their predeceſſors to be had of the ſame? Neither he bringeth any one witnes of any notable authority, or any doctor, either of his time, either of any other age, which denieth the Apocalips to be ſaint Iohns, ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing the teſtimony of Dioniſius Alexandrinus, whoſe reaſons are not of ſuch force, that they ſeme to exclude the Apocalips out of the number of the approued bookes of the new teſtament.

                     <p>Furthermore, that periphraſis wherwith Iohn doth note himſelf, in the title, muſt needes ſignifie to them which read with attention, that it is Iohns woorke.

                     <p>Beſides this, if they do well examine it according to the proporcion of fayth, they can finde nothing in it, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the apoſtolick doctrine. For although ſome thinges ſemed to be ſpoken not according to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of other ſcriptures (as that he doth pray for grace of the ſeuen ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites in the firſt chapter, and that Chriſt is called Alpha and Omega, and the beginning of the creature of God, in the third chapter, and of the thouſand yeares, in the which the godly ſhall raigne with Chriſt in the twenty chapter, the which Cerinthus, Papias, Iuſtinus, Ireneus, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderſtood that it ſhould be after the reſurrection) yet they dyd well perceaue thoſe phraſes miſtically to be vnderſtande, as in propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writinges.</p>
                     <p>And it is eaſy to be perceaued, many articles of the doctrine of the Apoſtles to be opened in it, as the article of iuſtification by the bloude of the Lambe, of repentaunce, of the reſurrection of the dead, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life, but eſpecially the doctrine of the Church. VVhoſe whole ſtate he doth wholye deſcribe, that it ſhoulde haue perſecutours, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, and other enemies, and yet that it ſhoulde remayne and continue with the miniſtery.</p>
                     <p>But eſpeciallye, he doth liuelye paynt and ſet foorth Antichriſt, of whom Daniell, Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and Ihon hym ſelfe in hys Epiſtles alſo do entreate, expreſsing hys name, the place, and the idolatrye whiche ſhoulde be committed by hym, the confuſion of hys raygne, and the worſhippers of the worlde, the perſecutions, the time howe long it ſhoulde endure, the reuelation of hym, and hys laſt deſtruction.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7195:66"/>
                     <p>Furthermore, they might wel vnderſtand, by conferring both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Apocalips doth not much ſwarue from the nature of the vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion of the prophets, and eſpecially of Ezechiel. Yea, rather it doth open and ſet them forth, of what ſorte the viſions of the <hi>.4.</hi> beaſtes are, &amp; of Gog &amp; Magog, &amp; of the meaſuring of the temple, &amp; other of like ſort.</p>
                     <p>Finally, if they did conſider either the preſent ſtate of the church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtate before, they might coniecture of the end, that the Apocalips proceded from the holy ghoſt, and not to be a booke vnworthy of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Iohn. For thoſe things which in the ſeuen firſt epiſtles are written vnto the ſeuen churches in Aſia, do ſet foorth the preſent ſtate of thoſe churches, either the ſtate which followed ſone after, which was knowen to euery man at that time, wherby they might haue declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of things folowing. For that in thoſe epiſtles, the biſhops of the Churches are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Angels, it was a declaration, that by other Angels alſo, both good &amp; euil preachers were vnderſtood &amp; ſignified. Furthermore that whych followeth, the which intreateth of Antichriſt and his kingdom, hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain notes, the which declare thoſe monſtrous images, as for example, that he calleth the harlot a city, the which beareth rule ouer the kinges of the earth, where he poynteth as though it were with his finger, vnto the city of Rome.

And as I ſayd a lytle before, Epicharmus ſuffred puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the handes of Hiero, for the rehearſall of certaine vnchaſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (but I ſpeake it with ſorrow of hart, to our vice ballet makers, and enditers of wanton ſonges, no reuengement, but rewardes are largelye payd and geuen.) Is not this the nouriſhing and feeding of ſuch Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, which deuour the chaſtitye both of ſingle and maryed women? O the noble voice and anſwer of Hiero his wife, geuen vnto him. He being in braule and contention with a certaine perſon, was embrayded with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnſauery breath of his mouth, did expoſtulate with his wife (whom he maryed a virgin) bicauſe ſhe neuer told him of that infirmity, which he might haue cured. I would (ſayth ſhe) haue admoniſhed you, but that I thought euery mans breath to be of the like ſauour. O what a ſeuere and ſtraight keeper of chaſtity was this faythfull and truſty wyfe? O what an example of continency is geuen here to all Matrones? O what a preſident of chaſtity is this, not to come ſo neare any other man, that ſhe did neuer ſauour his breath, but onely her own huſbandes?</p>
                     <p>Yf ſhe ment truly, as ſhe ſpake, there could be no greater argument of a notable continency. If ſhe diſſembled, yet was it a great ciuilitye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her huſband. It was likewiſe a marueilous tollerauncye, to ſuffer ſuch an incommodity, ſo long without lothſomnes?</p>
                     <p>Geradas, a very auncient man of Lacedemonia, being demaunded of hys hoſte, what payne adulterers ſuffered at Sparta, made this anſwer: <hi>O hoſpes, nemo apud nos fit adulter, neque fieri poteſt.</hi> O mine hoſt, ther is no adulterer among vs, neither can there be any. For this was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner among them, that they were neuer preſent at any Comedy, nor anye other playes, fearing leaſt they ſhould heare and ſee thoſe things, which were repugnant to their lawes.</p>
                     <p>In dede that which is wyllingly and gladly heard, is ſoone embraced and put in vre, nor it canne be farre ſet from wyll, which is ſeene with pleaſure. Plutarch in Pelopida writeth, that the Lacedemonians did ſo abandon all vnhoneſt pleaſure, and followed vertue, with ſuche labour, that one of the Sybarites denied the Lacedemonians to doo anye great atchiefe or act, when they did in battel ſo valeauntly offer themſelues to death, for they doo that (ſayth he) to be rydde of the trauels and baſe diet, whych they vſed at home.</p>
                     <p>O ſhameles wretche, an yll man, a diſſolute man, and a ryotous man to preſume to reproue the moſte valeaunt men, the beſt nurtured men, the moſt ciuill men of all the world.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7195:68"/>
                     <p>VVhat an impudent face was it? Of the Sybarites, and of their diſorders there be large volumes written by men moſt eloquent. <hi>Philo</hi> the Iewe in the life of Moſes, doth cal the leudnes of the Sibarites, <hi>Laſciua poemata,</hi> wanton poemes, ſonges and plaies: And Martiall nameth impudent and vnchaſte bookes <hi>Libros Sybariticos.</hi> The Syberites were the firſt that taught horſes to daunce, at the ſound of the troumpe. To be ſhort, ther is a prouerbe ſprong of them the prouerbe is, <hi>Sybaritica menſa,</hi> by which is ſignified all notorious riot, farre exceſsiue, gurmaundiſe, belly chere, al diſſolute and wanton maners, &amp; <hi>ſybariſſare,</hi> is nothing els, but to play the Epicure, and to become bond ſeruants to Bacchus and Venus.</p>
                     <p>But to reuert to our purpoſe, concerning wanton bookes, which can be no other thing, but the fruites of wanton men, who althoughe they write any one good ſentence in their works, yet for the vnworthines of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſons, the ſentence is reiected. The Senate of Lacedemonia would haue refuſed a worthy and a very apt ſaying of one Demoſthenes, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines of the author, if certaine men of authority called among them Ephori, had not come betwene, &amp; cauſed an other of the Senators to pronounce the ſentence againe as his own ſaying. Plutarch writeth, that there was a law among the Grecians, that euen the good bookes of ill men ſhould be deſtroyed, that the memory of the authours alſo, ſhould therby vtterly be blotted and cleane put away.</p>
                     <p>Gerſon, ſomtime chauncelour of Paris, ſpeaking of a certaine booke made by one Ioannes Meldinenſis, the title wherof is the Romant of the Roſe, writeth of that booke two thinges.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he ſayth, if I had the Romant of the Roſe, and that there were but one of them to be had, and might haue for it fiue hundred crownes, I had rather burne it, then ſell it.</p>
                     <p>Againe ſayth he, if I did vnderſtand that Ioannes Meldinenſis dyd not repent with true ſorow of minde, for the making and ſetting foorth of this booke, I would pray no more for him, then I would for Iudas Iſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riote, of whoſe damnation I am moſt certaine. And they alſo which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this booke, do apply it vnto wicked and wanton maners, are the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of his great paine and puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>The like Ioannes Raulius ſayd of the booke &amp; fables of one Operius Danus, that he was a moſt damned man; vnles he repented and acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledged his fault, for the ſetting forth of that booke. I would God they heard theſe things whom it delighteth to write or reade ſuch ſhameleſſe and laſciuious workes. Let them remember the ſaying of Saynt Paule: <hi>Quae ſeminauerit homo, eadem &amp; metet.</hi> A man ſhal reape thoſe things which he hath ſowen.</p>

For as the doore (ſayth he) is directed and holden vp by the hookes, ſo the Church of Rome is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned and ruled by the counſell of the Cardinals.</p>
                     <p>VVill you ſee here how ſome of the lawyars doth ſometimes racke, rent, and ſtretch fourth the holy ſcriptures, euen as the ſhoemakers do drawe and ſtretch fourth their lether with their teeth? Yf thoſe wordes ſpoken by Anna ſhould be ſo applied, that they which be called Cardinals ſhould gouerne the Chriſtian publique weale at Rome: why ſhould it not rather be referred vnto Biſhops and Prieſtes, which were long before the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and as chief and principall gouernours, did direct and order mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, which thing Andreas himſelfe doth proue by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of one Guido, Archdeacon of Bononie, whoſe wordes be theſe: In times paſt the chief prieſts or Biſhops in euery Church, were called Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, that is principall and heads: And then he procedeth. It is written in Deutronomie. If thou perceaue anye matter to be hard and doubte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be iudged, go vnto the Prieſtes of the Leuiticall order,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> and vnto the iudge, that is at that time appointed, for they ſhal declare vnto thee, the truth of the iudgement. And vpon this he ſayth, marcke here that the Leuitical Prieſts in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old Teſtament were counſellers, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuine law of God, although they were not called Cardinals, but ſuch Prieſts, now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes as are counſellers of the Lord, are called Cardinals. Here Siculus Andreas, doth not conſider, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Biſhops &amp; other inferior Prieſts did at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt occupy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place, which now Cardinals do occupy, the which gouerned
<pb facs="tcp:7195:73"/> the dioceſſe of Rome, together with the Biſhop of Rome, more then by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of a <hi>.1000.</hi> yeares before any man obteyned y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> glorious name of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, the whiche now euery where is of great eſtimation.</p>
                     <p>And therfore it may well be ſayd, that theſe Lordes Cardinals began but of late time, and lately ſucceded in the rowme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Leuitical Prieſts. But at length a long time after, when one Boniface the .iij. had obteyned of the Emperour Phocas to haue a prerogatiue aboue all other Biſhops, &amp; when alſo the Romaine Biſhop, with the whole ſenate of the Prieſts of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> citie began to haue authoritie and preeminence aboue all other, then theſe Prieſtes vnto whom theſe titles in times paſt were geuen, ſpecially the cure and charge of ſoules, began to be adorned with the name of Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinals, as a proper name of ſupreme dignitie, and ſo that function which at the beginning was onerous, at the laſt became honorable. In ſo much that Innocentius the fourth, which in the yeare of our Lord <hi>.1244.</hi> occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied that ſee, enacted at the laſt by a publique decree, that the Cardinals riding vpon horſes, ſhould were a read hat, that greater renoume might growe to that order. So that he in concluſion made the name and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Cardinals, famous, honorable, and very ſupreme and high, who at the firſt being but of a baſe calling, and very paynefull in the function, doth now place &amp; ſet all their ſanctimonie, holynes, and labour in vaine titles, of ſkarlet gownes, and red hattes, and be vnprofitable burdens of the earth, <hi>Fruges conſumere nati,</hi> waſtyng and deuouryng thoſe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, which ſhould ſuſtaine and maintaine a nomber of godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned preachers, <hi>Hec pro maxima parte, ex Polidoro &amp; Balaeo.</hi>

                        <p>The ſerpent did not ſpeake by his owne proper facultie and power, but by the inſtinct and operation of ſome other power, that is, either by the power of man, or by the operation of God, or els by the vertue of the good or ill ſpirites. He could not be impelled by the power of man, for Adam and Eue, which then as yet were onely alone, did not know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing which was done. Neither is it agreable that they could or ſhould geue the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſpeaking vnto the Serpent, for aſmuch as it was in a cauſe moſt per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitious and hurtful vnto themſelues. Neither can we, nor ought we to aſcribe this facte vnto the operation of God: for neither the temptation it ſelfe, neither the tranſgreſsion of the commaundement, neither the payne following, can ſuffer, that God might be thought to haue ſpoken vnto the woman by the Serpent in ſo crafty and gilefull maner. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the opinion which certain perſons, called Ophitae, held of the ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is moſt deteſtable and wicked.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly it cannot be ſayd that the good aungell did it, for the thing it ſelfe doth euidently declare, that it was not an aungell, which was the faithful Miniſter of God, &amp; a louer of man, but the enemie of God, and aduerſarie of man, and a very lyer and deceauer.</p>
                        <p>VVherfore it can no otherwiſe be concluded, but that the Serpent did ſpeake, by the inſtinct and inſtigation of the ill aungell.</p>
                        <p>The ſlaunderous cauillation of Iulianus Apoſtata, in the whiche he ſcoffingly demaundeth in what maner of ſpeache the Serpent communed with Eue, and wherein this fable doth differ from the fables feigned by the Grecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, is moſt found &amp; friuolous.

Notwithſtandyng this

                        <p>Therfore Satan choſed not either ſhepe or Pigeon or any other beaſt, but onely the helpe of the wyſeſt beaſt, to deceaue the woman, and did directe the Serpentes tounge, and did conceale and couer his owne acte and inſtinct, vnder the nature and wiſedome of the beaſt, that he might therby deliuer himſelfe from ſuſpition of his owne craft and deceite.</p>
                        <p>Saint Auſten vpon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> writeth that the Serpent was called wiſe, not properly in his one lyfe voyde of reaſon, but by the ſpirit of an other, that is, the deuill whiche was called the wiſeſt of all beaſtes.

                        <p>It is credibly and moſt like to be true, that the Serpent had not that ſhape of body which he hath now, for that he goeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his breſt, &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth on the ground, drawing his body after him, it came not that he was ſo made at the beginning, but by the curſe and vengeaunce of God inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon him, for the tempting of Eue. For God ſayd <hi>quia feceſti hoc, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictus es inter omnia animantia terrae, &amp;c.</hi> Bicauſe thou haſt done this, curſed art thou amonges all the beaſtes of the earth. Thou ſhalt go vpon thy breſt, and thou ſhalt eate earth al the daies of thy life. VVherfore it is to be gathered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Serpent at the beginning had an vpright body, a faire countenance, and pleaſant to behold. Beda writeth, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent had, before God curſed him, the face of a virgin. Luther ſayth, that he went vpright as a Cocke, but to diſpute aboute this, maketh not ſo greatly to edifye.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it is moſt certaine, that ther was not at the beginning ſuch enmity betwene the woman and the Serpent as is now, for that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity was inflicted after the fall, when God ſayd: <hi>Inimicitias pona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inter te &amp; mulierem,</hi> I wyl put enmities betwene thee and the woman. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no apparent reaſon, why the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould abhorre or feare the talke of the Serpent: yea, it may be geſſed, that the Serpent before this temptation, did inſinuate himſelfe vnto the woman, by a ſingular familiarity, whether this were done by a natural fauour and ſtudy, and ſo by that occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offred vnto Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or whether Satan by his inſtinct did moue the Serpent before, to enter ſuch familiarity with the woman, that he might be afterward the ſooner admitted to ſeduce and deceaue the woman by his temptation.</p>
                        <p>Cirillus doth ſuppoſe, that the woman did not feare the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Serpent, bicauſe through her ſimplicity ſhe thought it to be geuen to all beaſtes to ſpeake with mans voyce.</p>

Notwithſtanding, although this opinion haue ſome likelihood of truth, yet the prophet hath neuer the more eſtimation by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, for he is much more noble by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preeminence of viſions, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any king. For there be many worthy thinges to be recorded of him: firſt, that hys prophecy is ſet before other prophetes in the holy ſcriptures, which is not ſo to be vnderſtanded, that he was the firſt of all other, which dyd either prophecy or write. For ther were many other, which did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophecy, in his time with him, but alſo before him. As Nathan, Gad, Addo, and Ahias, did prophecy before him. And in his time did prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Oſeas, Amos, and Zacharias, not that Zachary which is the laſt of the twelue leſſer prophets, but an other of the ſame name, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. But yet their prophecies are ſet after, and placed among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the ſmaler prophets. The reaſon wherof is this. Although thys prophet Eſaias were not firſt, neither in order nor time, yet he is had of ſuch eſtimation, for the worthines and excellencye of his prophecies, that he is worthely ſet before the other. And truly, thoſe things which he prophecied of Chriſt, are ſo perſpicuous and playne, that he was counted of the auncient fathers, not onely a Prophet, but alſo an Euangeliſt and Apoſtle, and as it were, a preſent beholder of the croſſe of Chriſt. Saynt Hierome ſayth, that Eſaias writeth not a prophecy, but rather a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The ſcriptures of the new Teſtament do manifeſtly declare, of what efficacy and force his prophecies were in the eyes of Chriſt, of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geliſts, and of the Apoſtles. For ther is no booke of the old teſtament (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Pſalter of Dauid) out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which we reade moe teſtimonies to be brought in the new teſtament, then out of it. If you number them, you ſhal plainly perceaue that there be <hi>.60.</hi> places cited out of that booke, and <hi>64.</hi> out of the Pſalmes. Chriſt himſelf in the ſinagoge of Nazareth,<note place="margin">Lu. 4.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he roſe to reade, tooke the booke of this Prophet into his hands, did read it, and ſhut it agayne. Yea, this prophet was had in price among the very Heathen, as it appeareth in the hiſtory of a certayn Eunuch of Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, Candaces the quene of the Ethiopians chief gouernour. At the laſt when he moſt ſharply &amp; oftentimes had reproued Manaſſes the king of Hieruſalem, he was by him cauſed to be cut a ſunder with a woodden ſaw, and was buried vnder an oke, at a place called Rogel, which is a wel nigh vnto Hieruſalem.</p>

                     <p>The name of a prophet is taken ſomtime for a name of honor, as in the prophet Eſay,<note place="margin">Eſay. 8.</note> wher it is ſaid that Eſaias came <hi>ad prophetiſſam,</hi> he came vnto the prophetiſſe, which conceaued and bare a ſonne. Eſay meaneth it by his own wife (as Muſculus writeth) whom he calleth a prophetiſſe, not that ſhe had the gift of prophecy, as far as we can reade, but bicauſe ſhe was the wife of a prophet, whoſe office was moſt noble &amp; honorable Notwithſtanding ſome do referre the name of a prophetiſſe here, to the virgin Mary, and by this may we ſee, ther be, <hi>tot ſenſus, quot capita.</hi>

                     <p>Vnder the name of a prophet are vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſomtimes falſe prophetes, as in Zachary,<note place="margin">Zach 13.</note> &amp; they be knowen by <hi>.3.</hi> notes, which do diſcerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true prophets. The firſt note is, if they be taken in lies. Such were they in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lying ſpirit ſpake,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 22.</note> ſent of God to deceaue Achab. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d note is, if they ſpeake truth, &amp; that in the name of the Lord, which yet they ſpeake, for that end that they may deceaue the people, or if they prophecy openly, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of their falſe gods. The third note is, if in a rage, fury, or traunce, they foreſhew things to come, and yet vnderſtand no part of thoſe thinges which they vtter.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, the true tokens of godly prophets are three, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, piety, and intelligence. Verity conſiſteth in this, when thoſe thinges which they foreſhew, are certainly performed and done.</p>
                     <p>Piety, is when with their prophecies they do exhort the people vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtudy of godlines, &amp; induce them to the worſhipping of one true God.</p>
                     <p>Intelligence, is when they vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with a ſober minde thoſe things which they do prophecy. VVher theſe thre things do concurre, there is a moſt ſure argument of a true Prophet, endued with the ſpirite of God. And ſuch which are adourned with theſe thre properties, are inſtructed to prophecy thre maner of waies. Firſt, eyther by viſions and ſignes ſene in ſlepe, or by expres woords, or els by inſpiracion of the holy ſpirit. Of prophecy by viſions,<note place="margin">Num 12</note> you may reade in the booke of Numbers, where God ſayth. <hi>Si quis inter vos fuerit propheta domini, in viſione apparebo ei, et
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7195:79"/> per ſomnium loquar ad illum.</hi> If ther be a prophet of the Lord amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you, I wyll be knowen to him by a viſion, and wyl ſpeake vnto hym by dream. Of prophecy by expreſſe words without figures or ſhewes, is mencioned alſo in the ſame chapter, wher God ſayth: <hi>At non talis ſeruus meus Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ore enimad os laquar ei.</hi> But my ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Moſes is not ſo,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> who is faith ful in al mine houſe, vnto him wil I ſpeak mouth to mouth, &amp; by viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not in darke words, but he ſhal ſee the ſimilitude of the Lord. Of prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy by the inward inſpiration of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Num. 12.</note> we reade alſo in the booke of Numbers, wher it is recorded, how the <hi>.70.</hi> Elders, receiuing the ſpirit of God, did prophecy. In which place, &amp; in many other, ther is no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made, either of viſions, or of expres wordes.

                        <hi>Euſebius</hi> reciteth a very elegant hiſtory out of <hi>Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drinus,</hi> concerning Iohn. Clement (ſaith he) doth both note the time, and alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the hiſtory, being moſt neceſſary for all ſuch as are delighted with honeſt and profitable matters, which hiſtory <hi>Sozomenus</hi> alſo toucheth in his commentary. The words of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> are theſe. Heare a fable, and not a fable, but rather a true hiſtorie which is written of Iohn the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and left to be read of the poſteritie. The hiſtory is this: VVhen Iohn returned from the Ilande <hi>Pathmos,</hi> vnto <hi>Epheſus</hi> after the death of the tyraunt Domitian, he went, being requeſted, vnto ſuch places and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries as lay nigh about <hi>Epheſus,</hi> partly that he might conſtitute &amp; order Biſhops, partly that he might ſet in an order the Churches, and partly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might chuſe the clergie by lot, out of the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ſuch as wer appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the holy ghoſt. At what tyme therfore he came vnto a certaine ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie not farre diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Epheſus,</hi> (whoſe name alſo ſome do rehearſe) and when among other things he had comforted his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, turning his countenaunce vnto him that was appointed head and Biſhop ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, ſeing a certaine yonge man there being of a ſtrong body, a comlie face, &amp; of a feruent mind, I commit this yong man (ſayth he) moſt earneſtly vnto the, here before Chriſt and this congregation. VVhen the Biſhop had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him, promiſing him all diligence and endeuour, Iohn ſpeaking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame maner, requeſted him againe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond time. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterward he returned vnto <hi>Epheſus.</hi> But the Biſhop had this yong man home into his houſe, and kept him &amp; brought him vp, and wonne him vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge and light of the Goſpell: and at the laſt he was Baptized, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Chriſtian. But when the ſaid Paſtor became ouer gentle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe vnto him, he ſuffred this yong man to vſe the companie of idle and diſſolute and naughty perſons, to his great hurte and deſtruction, who
<pb facs="tcp:7195:82"/> firſt led him vnto ſumptuous ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ketting &amp; feaſting, and afterward they toke him with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to robbe and to ſteale in the night. After this, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed him to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt more heynous and greater actes, he being accuſtomed a litle &amp; litle, &amp; trayned in naughtines according to his ſtoute courage, like a couragious horſe and vntamed colte, hauing hys mouth hardened, gnawing vpon the bitte, and leauing the right way, was caried headlong toward hel more &amp; more. At the last diſpairing of his ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Christ, he toke in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no ſmall entrepriſes. And becauſe he had once periſhed, he thought to commit ſome great and notorious thyng, diſdaining to haue equall lot with his fellowes. Calling therfore his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions vnto him, and gathering together a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany and rablement of theues, he became a capitaine and head ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and began to be most cruell and moſt addict vnto manſlaughter. It chaunced in the meane tyme, that through vrge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and neceſſary buſines, the congregation of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſent for Iohn. VVho when he had ended ſuch matters, wherfore he came to them, ſayd to the Biſhop. Go to, go to, rendre agayne to vs that thing which Chriſt and I committed to thy charge, in the preſence of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherof thou art Paſtour and ruler. The Biſhop firſt of all was abaſhed, thyncking that certayne mony which he had not receiued, ſhould be demaunded of him, and he could not aunſwere for ſuch thinges, whiche he had not, and yet did not diſcredit Iohns wordes. But when Iohn had ſayd, I require a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the ſoule of my brother, the Biſhop bowing down his countenaunce, with ſighing and teares aunſwered, he truly is dead. Iohn demaunded how, and of what death. He ſayd he is dead vnto God, for he became an euell and a pernitious man, and in the ende he became a theefe and a common robber, and now of late hath he remayned with hys like companions in this hell againſt the Churche. The Apostle therfore hearing theſe words, rent his clothes, and with great lamentation ſmote him ſelfe vpon the head, ſaying. I haue left a good keper of my brothers ſoule, let me haue a horſe &amp; one to conduct me in the way: And ſo taking his horſe, he made as much haſt out of the congregation as might be. And when he came to the appointed place, he was taken of the ſcoute watches of the theues, &amp; neither flieng nor refuſing, cried, ſaying. I am come for this purpoſe, lead me vnto your Lord and maſter, who in the meane time looked for his pray all armed. Aſſone as he knew that it was Iohn that was brought, being aſhamed, fled away. Olde Saint Iohn followed with all his might, forgetting his great age, and cried vnto him. O my ſonne, why flieſt thou from me, why flieſt thou from thy father, a naked &amp; old man, haue pitie vpon me my ſonne, feare not, thou haſt yet ſome hope of ſaluation. I will rendre vnto Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Firſt he ſtoode ſtill: but with a ſad and heauy countenaunce, afterward he threw away his harneſſe, and forthwith trembled and wept full bitterly. He embraced Iohn when he came vnto him, and aunſwering with weping as wel as he could, was Baptized againe with teares, hauing his right hand onely hidden and couered. The Apoſtle when he had promiſed him, and had proteſted y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would obtaine remiſsion of his ſinnes, and had prayed &amp; falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon his knees, and had kiſſed his right hand, as purged again by repentaunce, he reduced him againe vnto the Churche. And after he had prayed for him with continuall interceſsion, and had ſtriued with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall faſtings, and had quieted and confirmed his minde with comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſayinges, he went not from him (as they ſay) vntill he had fully reſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red him vnto the Churche. And ſo gaue a goodly example of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, and a great experiment of regeneration, and a noble badge of the viſible reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> doth recite a ſtory worthy memorie:<note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> there be (ſaith he) which hard <hi>Policarpus,</hi> ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iohn the diſciple of the Lord goyng to be bathed at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when he ſaw <hi>Cerinthus</hi> within, did leape out of the bathe vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>waſhed ſaying, that he did feare, leaſt the bath would fall downe vpon them, foraſmuch as <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> the enemie of truth, was w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Finally of the death of Iohn there is no certainty. Saint Hierome doth ſay, that in the <hi>.68.</hi> yeares after the death of Chriſt, he died at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and was buried by the ſaid Citie.</p>
                     <p>Other do write, that Iohn went downe aliue into the graue, whiche he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his diſciples to make, and ſo bad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to couer him with earth, whiche being done, there appeared out of the graue a very great bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and manna alſo flowed out of it. But when theſe things cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taynly proued, they muſt be left to them which loue to read Legendes.</p>
                     <p>Some ſuppoſe, that young man which folowed Chriſt and was clothed in linen vpon his bare body, (and whom when the yong men would haue taught,<note place="margin">Marke, 14.</note> S.

Other do ſay, that it was Iames, the brother of the Lord, which was named <hi>Iuſtus,</hi> and who after the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt was made Biſhop of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> but it is an opinion voyde of reaſon to thincke, hym to be Iohn, for what nede was it to conceale hys name, when that the fall of Peter, being more fowle and greater, was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly declared. Furthermore Iohn did folow Chriſt ſtrayght waye when he was taken, and did helpe Peter to entre into the Biſhops palace, and how could he haue his clothes ſo ſone again, for aſmuch as he was a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:7195:83"/> at <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> Agayne the name of a yonge man did not agree vnto Iohn, for he was almoſt of the ſame age with Chriſt. Furthermore Iohn fled with all the other Apoſtles (as Saint Marke ſayth) <hi>Diſcipuli eius relinquentes eum, omnes fugerunt.</hi> All his diſciples leauyng him, did flye. Others do ſay, that he was a young man of the ſame houſe, in the whiche Chriſt kept his paſſeouer.

But let euerie man haue his ſentence. It maketh no great force who it was. But the holy Ghoſt woulde haue this example to be teſtified, that he myght ſhewe with what furie and rage the enemies did flee vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Chriſte, and that the miracles myght be more cleare, by the whiche he preſerued hys Diſciples that they ſhoulde ſuffer no hurte of theyr enemies, for when the rage was ſo great, that they layde their handes vpon an vnknowen ladde, who will doubte but that all his diſciples were preſerued by the hande and power of Chriſte? foraſmuche ſpecially as Peter by his fighting did prouoke the enemyes before. And here is left vnto vs, a document, that perſecution once begon, doth ſpare none, but is fierce and cruell againſt all, without exception, agaynſt hygh and lowe, yong and olde, ſparyng no ſexe, man, woman, childe or infant.</p>

VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Iewes were perſuaded that whatſoeuer was written in the Prophets, did come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord, it is no maruell that Peter ſayd, we haue a more ſure word. In the whiche words this is no queſtion to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

In whoſe ſtudye the Iewes are brought vp euen from theyr childhoode. In fine, Peter calleth it a more firme worde, for their ſakes whiche were infirme and weake in the fayth, to make the texte playne. Becauſe there were many, whiche as yet gaue no credit to the Goſpell, and to the preaching of the Apoſtles.

<pb facs="tcp:7195:84"/> nothynge, but that whiche was ſhewed before by the Prophetes.

On the other ſide, it is a moſt wicked prophanation of the Scriptures, when we arrogantly thruſt our ſelues in, to vnderſtand the Scripture by our owne wiſedome and our owne reaſon: for the Scriptures do conteyne hygh miſteryes of God, hidden and vnknowen vnto our heades. Yea it doth conteyne the noble treaſures of life, farre paſsing our capacitie.</p>
                     <p>Here maye we learne, that the proper and priuate interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7195:84"/> of the fathers are conuelled and quite ouerthrowne, and we be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to truſte and to leane to ſuche expoſitions. If Sainte Hierome, Saint Auſten, or any other of the fathers do expounde the Scriptures of themſelues or by their owne heades, we muſt refuſe their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For Sainte Peter doth here forbidde, any man to expounde the Scriptures by hys owne ſpirite. The true expoſition is propre, onely to the ſpirite of God. VVherefore, if any of the fathers can ſhewe hys enarrations, aptely to be taken out of any part of the Scriptures, which doe allowe the place by hym expounded to be ſo expounded in dede, we ought to embrace his interpretation, otherwiſe to geue no credit vnto hym nor his expoſitions.</p>
                     <p>The Papiſtes here do ſhewe themſelues to be twiſe fooliſhe and ignoraunt, when they gather out of this place, that the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of one priuate man ought not to be taken as auctenticall, but the interpretation of manie, and eſpecially of generall Councelles ought to be receyued (ſaye they.) In this they be childiſhely deceyued: for Peter here doth not call a priuate interpretation, the expoſition of one priuate man, but doth teache, that whatſoeuer commeth from manne or menne, fewe or manye, if they brynge nothyng but their owne iudgemente, to be prophane, and ought not to be receyued. Therefore if all the whole worlde ſhoulde conſpire together, and all their wyttes were layde together in one head, yet whatſoeuer ſhall come onelye from them, Sainte Peter doth counte it nothynge but proper and priuate. For the Prophetes and other holye menne of God beyng inſpired of the holy Ghoſt, dyd wryte and ſpeake that whiche they vttered. VVithout the whiche ſpirite, whatſoeuer one or manye doe brynge, is nothynge elles but priuate, (that is to ſaye) theyr owne imaginations.</p>
                     <p>To make it playne, Saint Peter here doth put downe the pride of certeine vaine men, and ſpecially of the Iewes, who flattering them ſelues with the perſuaſion of great readyng and much learnyng, thought they might interprete the Scriptures as pleaſed them. God forbidde (ſayth Peter,) for then were the gifte of Prophecie, comming from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt, in vaine, which prophecie is ſo to be expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, as the holy ghoſt doth inſpire, and not by priuate interpretation of any other whatſoeuer they be, and how many ſoeuer they be.</p>
                     <p>Other learned men do expounde this place of priuate interpretation, to be nothyng els but that the holy Scriptures were not geuen by man, nor by the power of man, but by the holy ghoſt, as Peter ſayth after in

And in many of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles he doth greatly commend him, for the ſinguler and rare giftes that were in him, as for the conſtancie of his faith, his integritie and ſoundnes of life, and ſuch other notable vertues and qualities. Paule vſed him his companion in his peregrinations, in his meſſages, and diuerſe and ſondrie other wayes. VVhen Paule was by tumulte caſte out of Theſſalonica, he lefte Timothie there with Sila.

The cauſe why he would not circumciſe him, he rendreth in the ſame place, ſaying bycauſe of the falſe brethren that crepte in, who came in priuily to ſpie out our libertie, which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus, to bryng vs into bondage. Circumciſion being a thing then counted indifferent, was thought either to be vſed, or omitted, as edification myght riſe therof: And this rule is alwayes to be reſpected, that all thinges are lawfull, yet all thinges are not expedient. Paule therfore circumciſed Timothie, leaſt he ſhould haue geuen an offence vnto the infirme and weake brethren. And than he was conuerſaunt and remayned amongeſt the weake, to whom he ought to geue place for a tyme. And he might haue done the like in Titus, but the ſtate and condition was diuerſe from the other, for certayne falſe brethren were there alwayes in a redynes, to ſlaunder him and his doctrine, and would haue ſayd: Beholde this bolde marchaunt
<pb facs="tcp:7195:86"/> Paule, whiche is ſo ſtoute a chalenger of libertie, when he once commeth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles, he is ſore quayled, and putteth downe hys ſtoutnes. And note here, that when Saint Paule denieth Tite to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, by reaſon of the falſe brethren, the wordes may be taken two maner of wayes. The firſt is this: They that owe no good will vnto my preachyng, could not obtayne at my hande, that I woulde circumciſe Titus beyng a gentile, no not amonge the Iewes, whiche were conuerted vnto Chriſt And this did I to defende my libertie agaynſt them, whiche thought and taught that circumciſion was neceſſary to ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>The ſeconde ſenſe and meaning is, this Paule, of a ſet purpoſe would not circumciſe Titus: for he knewe, that certayne thruſt them ſelues into his company, either to get him enemies among the Iewes, if he would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpiſe their ceremonies, or els if he had wholly refrayned from the Christian libertie, than they would haue triumphed agaynſt hym among the Gentiles, as agaynſt one that beyng confuſed, had retracted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked his former doctrine. Therfore as ſometyme we muſt beare with the weake in the beginnyng, ſo ought we alſo ſtoutlye to defende the chriſtian libertie againſt the wicked, who will make a thing of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce neceſſary to ſaluation.

For when there were at that tyme moe monumentes, and other infallible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the ſaid Irenaeus in the handes of the godly and learned, then are now had or may be had: who could geue a more certayne iudgement of Irenaeus doings, then Euſebius, aboue all other that followed him?</p>
                     <p>Of what parentes, or in what place he was borne, it is vncertayne, yet I will ſhew you hereafter the coniectures of certayne learned men. In his youth he was conuerſaunt in the ſchoole of Policarpus, who was Biſhop of Smirna, and one of the diſciples of Iohn the Euangeliſt. He heard this reuerend, graue, and godly man with ſo great admiration and attention, that he moſt depely engraued in his breſt Policarpus doctrine, and what ſoeuer he receiued of him, kept it in a moſt liuely memorie, vntill he came to extreme age. VVherupon ſome write that Ireneus did deſcribe &amp; ſet forth, euen as he ſaw with his own eyes, the geſtures of Policarpus, and did declare w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what things, and with what words he was wont to reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Of thys, coniecture may be made, that Irenaeus was an Aſian borne, &amp; not farre from Smyrna. To this opinion is much agreable that a Greeke name was geuen vnto him: for this word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap> betokeneth <hi>pacificum.</hi> And as good lucke is ſometimes the inſetting of names, ſo the euent and ſucceſſe did proue in Ireneus, for he was moſt ſtudious of peace and tranquility in the church of Chriſt. But let it be that he was borne in Europa, it is the more to be marueiled by what meanes he came into Polycarpus ſchole. He ſo paſſed ouer the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his youth, that he knew al liberal artes, beſide chriſtian piety: for theſe ſubtill and moſt conſtant diſputations which he had againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, doth manifeſtly declare that he was not rude nor ignoraunt of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane artes, for the monſtrous opinions of heretickes, were builded vpon the foundacion of prophane Philoſophers, of the which opinions to iudge ſo exactly, and to confute with ſuch arte and ſtrong argument, he could not haue done, vnleſſe he had bene very expert in prophane ſtudies. Nor it is without cauſe, that Tertullian did beautify him with his praiſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he was a moſt curious ſearcher of al doctrines, but ſpecially dyd employ his diligence and labour in the knowledge of Chriſtes doctrine, and did chiefly adioyne himſelfe vnto the company of them, who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dourned with the ſingular giftes of the doctrine of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>He exerciſed the function of prieſthod in the church of Lions, which is a notable city, and noble Marte in Fraunce, in which place wythout
<pb facs="tcp:7195:87"/> doubt he did moſt ſincerely, and with ſingular dexterity, expounde the ſcriptures. He liued moſt familiarlye with one Photinus, a reuerende, graue, and conſtant father.</p>
                     <p>But perchaunce ſome deſire more to haue the knowledge of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke factes and doinges.</p>
                     <p>The church of Aſia was much vexed, as it were with inteſtine &amp; ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warre, when Montanus, Alcibiades, and Theodotus, did moleſt the ſound doctrine of the Goſpel, with their new prophecies, and vayne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies. For theſe fantaſticall ſpirits, did marueilouſly bewitch the mindes of men, and wrapped them in great errors. The French church therfore, being moued with a certayne louyng zeale towarde the brethren of the church of Aſia, did ſend their iudgement of the doctrine of their falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets, vnto the churches which were in Aſia and Phrigia, and did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their helping hands, againſt the corrupters of the Goſpel. That this legacy ſhould be the more honeſt and fruitfull, they perſwaded Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus, that he as a meſſenger would cary their letters in ſo great a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and that he would alſo comfort with his own voice, the afflicted &amp; troubled churches, and confirme them in the truth already knowen, and manfully confute the errors of theſe heretickes. In this iourney Ireneus paſſed by Rome, and ſaluted the biſhop ther, he had letters alſo from the French churches, by the which he was honorably commended vnto Elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius then biſhop ther: the copy of which letters, Euſebius doth record. The tenor wherof here followeth.<note place="margin">Lil. 5. cap. 4,</note>

                     <p>Theſe words are alledged out of that Epiſtle, which doubtles was lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger, and comprehended more things, which if they were extant, would make very much for this preſent purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>VVhen Photinus was murthered for the confeſsion of the euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call truth, Irenaeus was choſen in his roume, who ſo ruled this church and did inſtructe it with ſuch doctrine and integritie of life, that he was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; worſhipped both of his own countrymen, &amp; alſo of ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers. He had great conflictes with a great number of heretikes, but ſpecially with the Valentinians, agaynſt whom he wrote a notable booke which is nowe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7195:87"/> extant. He had alſo an action againſt Victor then Biſhop of Rome, the cauſe was this. The controuerſy for keping of Eaſter day, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moued, began now to waxe hot, &amp; broke out at this time into a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſciſme, &amp; there was throwne as it were an apple of contention, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene the two churches, the eaſt and the weſt. For the eaſt church was fully reſolued to kepe their liberty and old cuſtome concerning the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and refuſed in any wiſe the yoke of al ceremonial obſeruations, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vpon Victor being moued, did excommunicate all Churches diſſenting from the church of Rome. And although the paſtors in Aſia did teach by moſt weighty arguments, that they could not depart from their cuſtome receiued of the Apoſtles them ſelues, yet they did litle preuail therwith. Ireneus therfore with his brethren of the French churches, not thinking it good to behold this lamentable contention in the church of Chriſt, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, as it may be coniectured, a counſell, in the which they made let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; ſubſcribing them with their own hands, ſent them to Victor the biſhop of Rome, hauing good hope that they ſhould mitigate and breake the rage of Victor, and ſo bring tranquility into the church againe. As touching the ſentence of the feaſt of Eaſter, to be kept vpon the Sonday, they approued Victors minde and iudgement, as pertayning to the weſt church: but that he ſhould not alienate or chaunge other churches, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the cuſtome of their old tradition, they did exhorte him with many profound arguments. He had in his writings certaine ſpots, whereby he was noted and ſuſpected, not to be of a moſt ſound iudgement. Firſt he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not playnly to make a difference betwene <hi>verbum ſubſtantiale,</hi> that is Chriſt, <hi>&amp; verbum vocale.</hi> Secondly, he ſemed to iudge, that man in the beginning was not made perfect, and that ſentence which was ſpoken of man to be made after the image of God, to be ſpoken of Chriſt. Thirdly, he doth geue vnto man free wyl, in cauſes ſpirituall. Fourthly, he ſayth that Chriſt was baptized in the thirty yeare of his age, and to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone his preaching at the age of forty, and ſuffered his paſsion at the age of fifty, and doth relate that the Elders of Aſia, did learne this of Iohn.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 40 &amp;. 43.</note> Finally, the errours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Millinaries is imputed vnto Ireneus, but theſe things cannot be gathered expreſly out of his bookes.

                     <p>VVhen Nectarius was dead, Chriſoſtome was choſen biſhop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, by the commaundement of Arcadius,<note place="margin">Theodoretus Lib. 5. cap. 28.

He was had away by the Emperour from Antioche, againſt the inhabitantes will, and was ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned byſhop, by a counſel aſsembled together very ſolemnely.</p>
                     <p>He was endewed with ſingular gifts: for beſides the knowledge of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral ſciences, of philoſophy, and of the toungs, he was very excellentlye ſene in the holy ſcriptures. He was very apt and ready to teach, and in his words he had a marueilous faculty to perſwade. He was ſo eloquent, that this name Chriſoſtome was geuen to him, which betokeneth golden mouth. He was of a ſtout and conſtant minde. Some ſay that he had the gift to heale all maner of diſeaſes. In the adminiſtracion of his biſhoprick he behaued him ſelf very faithfull, conſtant, and like a vigilant Miniſter of Chriſt. He preached often, and in his preaching did apply him ſelfe to the capacity of his auditours and hearers. He rebuked ſynne ſo ſharply, as though he had ſuſtained ſome iniury himſelf. And cauſed them whych wer gilty in conſcience, to breake forth oftentimes into teares and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. He did not onely touch the faultes of the common people,<note place="margin">Sozo. Lib. 8. cap. 16.</note> but the ſinnes of all ſortes, with great liberty of toung. He reprehended y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> empreſſe,<note place="margin">Nicepho Li. 13. cap. 13.</note> and did exhort her to reſtore againe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vineyard which ſhe had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Calitropa.

                     <p>He did inſtitute and ordaine praiers to be ſayd in the night agaynſt the Arrians. If he perceaued any vnworthy of the office of prieſthoode, either through ignoraunce or filthines of life, he depoſed them, and dyd ſubſtitute others more mete and worthye. He did profitte the church not onely by his voyce, but alſo by his writing. VVhen he was but a reader, he
<pb facs="tcp:7195:89"/> wrote a boke againſt the Iewes, and certaine homelies <hi>De vita monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> VVhen he was Deacon, he made bookes and certain dialoges of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and three bookes <hi>Ad Stagirium Daemoniacum.</hi> VVhen he was prieſt, he made many commentaries and expoſitions vpon many bookes of the ſcripture,<note place="margin">Niceph. lib. 13. cap. 2.</note> as vpon Geneſis and other bookes of the old teſtament, vpon the Goſpels,<note place="margin">Socra. Lib 6. cap 4.</note> vpon the pſalmes. &amp;c. VVhen he was biſhop, he made many notable ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, partly writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of himſelf, partly of certain notaries.</p>
                     <p>Al his workes which are now extant, are digeſted into fiue tomes. In the firſt tome are contained the commentaries which he wrote vpon the old teſtament. In the ſecond, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpon Mathew, Marke, &amp; Luke. In the third, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpon Iohn, and the actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, wherin alſo are certain ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; certain apologies.

                     <p>Although he was very ſtudious of tranquility, and a louer of peace, yet when he was biſhop, he was muche moleſted and vexed by falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by courtiers, by heretiks, and heathen men.</p>
                     <p>Concerning falſe brethren, whan he by reaſon of his office, was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to amend the maners and life of his Clergie, ſome of them tooke it grieuouſly, and accuſed him of to much auſterity and rigour, and toke an occaſion euery way to ſpeake ill of him. Other ſlaundred him, bicauſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapion a Deacon did ſay, that he could not rule them, except he woulde beate them alway with one ſtaffe, wherupon they called him a proud &amp; an ambitious man. They found fault with him alſo, bicauſe he did alwaies eate alone without company, as though he did contemne and loth others. But his aduerſaries did litle preuayle with theſe reproches. For all men had him in much eſtimation and honor, for the ſingular gift of teaching, and it was well knowen, that through his ſickly ſtate, and by the reaſon of the infirmity of his head and ſtomacke,<note place="margin">Nicepho Li. 13. cap 9. Socra. Lib. 6. cap. 4.</note> and his great abſtinence, he did eſchew and auoyde all feaſtes and banckets.</p>
                     <p>He had great contention with one Seuerianus, who in his abſence did much trouble the church, which contention Serapion did ſo muche augment, that Seuerianus was expelled out of the city. For this Serapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did falſly accuſe him, &amp; ſayd y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did affirme Chriſte not to be made man, when he ment nor ſayd no ſuch thing. For theſe were his woordes: <hi>Si Serapion Chriſtianus fuerit mortuus, Chriſtus homo non eſt factus.</hi> If Serapion die a chriſten man, then Chriſt is not made man.</p>
                     <p>He was alſo in contention with one Theophilus, Biſhop of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, which roſe by this occaſion. VVhen one Dioſcorus, and certayne Monckes, called <hi>Longi fratres,</hi> came to Conſtantinople to the emperour,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7195:89"/> and to Iohn, and had complained of the inurye which Theophilus had done vnto them, Iohn did receiue them honorablye, and did gentlye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayne them, and did admit them vnto common praiers, yet did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them from the Communion, vntil their cauſe ſhoulde be hearde and debated.</p>
                     <p>VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fame &amp; report of this was brought to Theophilus, and that Iohn alſo had admitted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the holi miſteries, Theophilus did craftely imagine, how he might reuenge himſelf of Iohn, &amp; to depoſe him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his office, which he attempted this way. Theophilus reconciled him ſelf vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Epiphanius which was before offended with him, and did prouoke &amp; allure him to condemne Origines bookes. Epiphanius not perceiuing this crafty fetch, did obey him, and wrote vnto Iohn, that he alſo woulde ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne from the reading of Origines bookes, and that he would cal a coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell, and make a decree therof.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, Theophilus alſo dyd call a counſell, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the bookes of Origen: but Iohn not regarding the letters of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, tooke heede to his owne office and charge. Nowe when they of the Clergye, and of the Emperours court, vnderſtoode what Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus went about to compaſſe, they alſo did put their helping handes,<note place="margin">Socrat, Lib. 3. cap. 10.</note> and cauſed a counſel to be called to Conſtantinople. A little after Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius came to Conſtantinople, and without the citye did celebrate the ſupper of our Lorde, and ordayned a Deacon: and calling vnto him certaine Biſhoppes, did rehearſe vnto them the condemnacion of Origines bookes. Iohn did inuite and bid him vnto his houſe, but hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, he would not come, no not to pray with him, before hee had ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Dioſcorus out of the Citye, and hadde alſo ſubſcribed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnacion of Origines bookes. Iohn on the contrarye ſide ſayde, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to bee done raſhlye, before an vniuerſall knowledge might be had therein.</p>
                     <p>VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Epiphanius came abrode openly, and would haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines bokes, and would haue drawen Dioſcorus out of the citie, and haue accuſed Iohn, Iohn ſent vnto him Serapion, who ſayd theſe words. O Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, thou dooſt many thinges againſt the Canons. Firſt, for that thou haſt geuen orders in the churches within my iuriſdiction. Secondlye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt without my commaundement or ſufferaunce, celebrated the holy miſteries. Finally, bicauſe being gently bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of me to my houſe, thou diddeſt refuſe. Take hede therfore, leaſt there be a tumult rayſed by the people, and thou alſo be wrapped in the daunger therof.</p>
                     <p>VVhen Epiphanius heard thys, he went out of the Churche, and as he was goyng, ſayde: <hi>Spero te non moriturum Epiſcopum.</hi> I hope thou
<pb facs="tcp:7195:90"/> ſhalt not die a byſhop.<note place="margin">Soc, lib. 6 ca. 14</note> To whom Iohn anſwered, <hi>Spero te non ingreſſuru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> patriam tuam,</hi> I hope thou ſhalt not returne into thy country. The euent did approue and verify both their words: for Epiphanius died in the ſhip, before he came home, and Iohn was a litle after depoſed from hys ſee.</p>
                     <p>Concerning temporal men, and eſpecially them of the court, he ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many afflictions, and much trouble. They were offended wyth hym for no other cauſe, but for that he did ſharply and frely reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded their diſordered life. He tooke vp very ſharply, and rebuked Eutropius, lying before the altar, bicauſe when he had cauſed a law to be made, that no fauour ſhould be ſhewed vnto offenders, which did flee to the altar, and yet he himſelfe did couet to vſe that ſame priuiledge, and ſo to ſaue hys life. The nobles of the court tooke theſe words in very il part, &amp; accuſed him to be an vnmercyfull man, and called him <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that is ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and malicious.</p>
                     <p>Gainas alſo captaine of the hoſt, was much againſt him, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue vnto him, bicauſe when Gainas did requeſt before the emperour and certaine biſhops, that one certayne church ſhoulde be aſsigned vnto the Arrians at Conſtantinople, Iohn did plainly and openly ſay, that hys requeſt was wicked, and that the emperour could not without treaſon to Gods houſe, and without abrogation of certaine lawes made of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetors, ſuffer any conuenticles of the Arrians within the city, and did em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>braid alſo Gainas wyth hys country and fliyng from thence,<note place="margin">Soc. Lib 6. ca. 5. Sozora. Li. 8, cap. 4.</note> and did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto him periury.</p>
                     <p>Eudoxia alſo the Empereſſe, was ſore ſet againſt him, for expelling of Seuerianus out of the City, &amp; did prouoke Epiphanius againſt hym, wherof when Iohn had knowledge, he made a very ſharp ſermon againſt the enormities of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. His aduerſaries taking ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfaſt of this, brought it to the court, wher all flatterers made an exclamation, that it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthely done of Iohn, and accuſed him as one gilty of treaſon. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe her ſelfe made her complaint to the Emperour, that ſhe was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contumeliouſly handled, and requeſted him to haue a regard of her ſtate and calling. VVherupon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperour conſentyng, a counſel was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, in the which Theophilus Alexandrinus and many other, which bare malice vnto Iohn, came to Calcedon, wher Cyrinus the biſhoppe dyd ſpred many reproches &amp; rebukes againſt Iohn, &amp; ſaid, that he was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant &amp; proud man, &amp; one that would neither bow nor breake, which words wer receiued of the biſhops, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great ioy and reioycing. But Iohn refuſing to appeare in that ſynode, &amp; appealing to a general cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, was condemned, &amp; ſent into exile into a towne by the ſea ſide, called Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the multitude &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people,<note place="margin">Socrat. Lib. 6. cap. 16.</note> riſing (as it wer) in a tumult, Iohn was called again from exile of the emperour, and reſtored vnto his ſee.</p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:7195:90"/>
                     <p>Not long after, when certain enterludes and plaies were practiſed at the ſiluer image of the Empreſſe, which image was ſet by the Church of Sophia, Iohn in his ſermon did reprehend it Eudoxia the empreſſe, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be reuenged, called againe an other counſel. Then Iohn made ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the church, that homely or ſermon which beginneth thus: <hi>Rurſus Herodias inſanit, rurſus turbatur, rurſus ſaltat, rurſus in diſco caput Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis accipere quaerit.</hi> Herodias againe waxeth mad, againe ſhe is trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled, againe ſhe daunceth, againe ſhe ſeeketh Iohns head in a diſhe. But when the biſhops were come together, he deſired that inquiſition might be made of the crimes obiected againſt him of his aduerſaries: but they neglecting al other things, went about that that was more plauſible and pleaſaunt vnto them, that is to ſaye, they layde to Iohns charge, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was depoſed, he entred againe into his biſhopricke, of his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without the ſentence and conſent of any counſell. And although Iohn did reply, that he was reſtored againe of .v. or .vi. biſhoppes, and dyd ſhew that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> canon which they alledged, was a canon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arrians againſt Athanaſius, yet he was condemned and remoued from his miniſtery, and ſo baniſhed at the laſt by the inſtaunce of Seuerianus Porphyrius, and other Byſhoppes of Siria, vnto a place named Pitymita,<note place="margin">Sozo Lib. 8. cap. 18.</note> ſituate in the vt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>termoſt coaſt of all the Romane Empire.

After his death great diſſention folowed among the byſhoppes, of whom ſome condemned him, and ſome dyd defend his cauſe and innocency. His bones at the requeſt of Proclus, were tranſlated to Conſtantinoble.</p>
                     <p>That Peter and Iohn the Apoſtles did appeare to him the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, and did ſhew to him the victory againſt the deuils,<note place="margin">Niceph. lib. 13. cap. 37.

                     <p>Concerning the ſanctimony of his life, he lyued chaſte, and did vtterly abſtaine from al feaſtes, and was very liberal towards the poore, and was in great eſtimation emong the learned.</p>

So the martyrs, &amp;c. Here you ſee how this godly martyr &amp; Byſhop, ſaint Cyprian doth clearely affirme, that no doctrine is to be receyued in the Churche by the authoritie of the Biſhop, or for the holynes of martyrs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſcriptures, but they muſt proue their doctrine to be ſound, out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, before they put it to the Churche. Therfore it may be concluded, that they whiche attribute vnto the Church &amp; to the fathers, authoritie to ordeine any thyng with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſcripture, and to define of controuerſies of religion, without the word, do offer great iniurie and wrong to the primatiue Churche. And what can be more clearely ſpoken, then that whiche was alleged before in S.

                     </gap>, of our priuate interpretation, or to be comparde with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries of men? Saint Peter will in any wiſe theſe two, to be diſtinct one from the other, euen as the iudge and the thing to be iudged, as light and darkenes to be lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are diſtinct thinges, euen ſo Peter doth not make our priuate interpretation iudge of the Scripture, but contrary, maketh the Scripture iudge of our interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. He doth not ſaye that the interpreters giue light vnto the Scripture, but the Scripture to be a Lanterne and Candle to diſcuſſe and ſhake of the darckenes of all priuate interpretation. This cauillation therfore of the deuill is moſt vile and full of poyſon, by the whiche he would perſuade the worde of God to be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, darcke, ambiguous and doubtfull, that it can not be vnderſtande without the commentaries of men, and the expoſition of the Church. But what is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils drift I pray you? forſooth nothing els, but to driue euery man from readyng of the ſcriptures, and to make the word of God odious to all men. But will you haue the truth? The aunſwers of the deuil him ſelfe are ſo obſcure and doubtful, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> almoſt is able to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them.

On the contrarie ſide, it is Gods propertie to teach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth plainly, &amp; to giue life, to which appertaineth light, certeinty, affiaunce, truſt, &amp; perfect fayth.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Saint Auſten</hi> doth ſay the Churche to be that congregation, whiche doth holde the wordes of he bread Chriſt. His words be theſe. <hi>Queſtio eſt vbi ſit eccleſia, quid ergo facturi ſumus? In verbis noſtris, an in verbis capitis domini noſtri Ieſu Chriſti quaerimus? puto quod in illius verbis quaerere debemus, qui veritas eſt, &amp; optime no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit corpus ſuum.</hi> There is a queſtion where the Church is, what ſhall we therfore do? ſhall we ſeke it in our owne wordes, or in the wordes of our head our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Saint Paule</hi> doth call them the Churche, whiche are buylded vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtles and Prophetes.<note place="margin">

As Paule writeth to the Colloſſians. And thus you ſee, that the Churche in this hath done nothing but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie of the word. Furthermore the Sabboth of the Iewes was aboliſhed by the Apoſtles them ſelues, &amp; ſo it is recorded in the Scriptures, as in the Actes of the Apoſtles, it is writen that the firſt daye of the weeke the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples came together to breake bread. The firſt day of the weeke, we call Sonday. And by this place and many other mo we gather, that the Chriſtians vſed to haue the ſolemne aſſemblyes, layeng aſſide the Ceremonies of the Iewes Sabboth. And bycauſe the Iewes were ſo ſuperſtitiouſly wedded &amp; addicte vnto the ſabboth day, the Apoſtles did abrogate it, and place in the ſtede thereof the Sonday, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the reſurrection of the Lord (whiche was done that day) brought an ende to all ſhadowes of the lawe. And that day doth admoniſhe vs of our Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For as by the diſpoſyng of the law, the Sabboth was celebrate and kepte, to keepe in remembraunce the makyng of the worlde. So the Sonday is nowe obſerued to put vs in remembraunce of the reſurrection of Chriſte, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the hope of our reſurrection. In this day Saint Paule ordeyned at Galatia and at Corinthium, that collection and gatheryng for the poore ſhould be vſed. Of this day Saint Iohn ſpeaketh in the reuelation ſaying, <hi>Fui in Spiritu in domi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nica die.</hi> I was rauiſhed in ſpirite on the Lordes day.</p>

Wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it may be concluded, that be which is baptiſed in Chriſt, is baptiſed alſo in the name of the father: To be baptiſed of Chriſt, is to be made the annoynted of God the father, which hath annoynted him, and in the holy ghoſt, by whom he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted of the father.

And <hi>Chriſtus,</hi> in greke is <hi>Vnctus,</hi> annointed, &amp; in that name the holy trinity is vnderſtand, the father who doth an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noint the ſonne which is annointed, the holly ghoſt whiche is the vnction it ſelfe And Chriſt can not be conceiued and apprehended by faith, without the father, of whome he was geuen vnto vs, nor without the holly ghoſt, by whom he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new &amp; ſanctify vs. Therfore, this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the papiſts is nothing worth, by the which they chalendge autoritye to chaunge the inſtitution and order of Chriſte.

                        <hi>Liuius</hi> doth write, that Lucius Albinus one of the commons, did bring the virgin Prieſts and all the holy things vnto the towne Cere in a carte or wayne (wherof ſprang this name <hi>Caeremonia</hi>) which name we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do now retayne and vſe, calling the rites and formes of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ceremonies, yet we do make a difference betwene the ceremonies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, &amp; other preſcribed by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: of the which later ſort, there hath bene a great heape, not onely vayne, fooliſh and ſuperfluous, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo blaſphemous and iniurious to the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Saint Auſten in his Epiſtle <hi>Ad Ianuarium</hi> did take it in very ill part, that in his tyme the Churche of Chriſt, whiche God of hys mercye would to be free with a fewe ordinaunces, was Prieſt with ſo many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile burdens and bondages, in ſo muche that the condition and ſtate of the Iewes ſemed more tollerable and more eaſie, then the Churche of the Chriſtians.</p>

                        <p>The law ceremonial did contain certain externe ceremonies, which (as Rabbi Salomon writeth) were <hi>.600.</hi> in number, and wer onely figures, and not ordeined to remaine for euer (as Paul writeth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrues) <hi>Ad tempus correctionis,</hi> which was a figure, and they wer carnal rites, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>til the time of reformation, that is vntil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was appointed.</p>

                        <p>Saint Hierome is very ſore againſt the obſeruers of the ceremonies of the Iewes. His wordes be theſe: <hi>Ego libera voce pronuncio, caeremonias Iudeorum &amp; pernitioſas eſſe, &amp; mortiferas Chriſtianis, &amp; quicunque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as obſeruanerit, ſiue ex Iudaeis ſiue exgentilibus, eum in Barathrum dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli deuolutum.</hi> I do frely pronounce and ſay, that the ceremonies of the Iewes be pernitious and moſt deadly vnto Chriſtians, and that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doo obſerue them, whether he be Iew or Gentile, ſhalbe thruſt down to the gulfe or dongeon of the deuill. But ſome ſuppoſe Hierome to haue ſpoken this in his coller againſt ſaynt Auſten.</p>
                        <p>For great diuines hold, that to obſerue a ceremony with a Iew, is not mortal of it ſelfe, but the opinion that perſwadeth a man to put hope or confidence in the worke, as a thing helping to iuſtification, is peſtiferous and eroneous. If circumciſion in the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t had bene mortal, why did Paule circumciſe Timothy? why did he make a vowe, <hi>in cenchreis?</hi> why did he ſhaue his head?

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ouinianus, who was firſt a ſolitary monke, and afterward becam one of the clergy, being but a baſe man of birth, but rich, neither learned nor yet eloquent, endeuoured to renew the hereſy af Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilides, being of long time before buried and extinguiſhed, writing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries vpon the ſame matter, in the which he went aboute to proue out of the teſtimonies of the ſcriptures, yll vnderſtanded, that ſuche as were truely baptized, could not falagaine into ſynne. The which errour ſaint Auſten aſcribeth vnto Pelagius. Thoſe thinges when he taught at Rome, he was able to draw into his errour none of the Prieſtes, nor any of the Clergie, being of any name or eſtimation: he onely corrupted cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ſimple wemen, in ſo much that when this was heard of certaine ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred virgins, being ſtriken wel in yeares, maried huſbandes. But he hym ſelfe would not mary a wyfe, not bicauſe he hoped to receiue any reward for it, but bicauſe he would not be entangled with the troubles of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and bicauſe he woulde be at more liberty. Saint Auſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth lay cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine errours vnto Iouinianus his charge, which notwithſtanding Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome doth not impute vnto him. That is, that the virgin Mary, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Ieſu, was defiled in her childbirth, &amp; that al offences wer equal, as the opinion of the Stoickes was. But it doth appeare, that ſaint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten neuer red either the bookes of Iouinianus, or the booke of Hierome againſt Iouinian, but did onely learne of the rumour of the people. But he declareth notwithſtanding, that ther was no mention made of Iouini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, either of Epiphanius, either of Philaſtrinus in his Cataloge of Arch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>heretickes, but that he found in a certayne booke, without any title of the authour of it, that Iouinianus was numbred among the Archeheretickes. He ſayth furthermore, that this hereſy ſpranke vp, he being but a childe, and that it was forth with repreſſed, infecting none of the prieſtes. But it doth appeare, that his hereſy was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by the meanes of one Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torinus and Pammacbius, and before that Hierome wrote againſt him.

                     <p>Ther was alſo an other Iouinianus, who was the fourth emperour of Conſtantinople, next after Iulianus Apoſtata, he raigned eight monethes. Thys chriſtian emperour was borne in the country of Pannonia, indued

Neither is it thought, that this was demaunded of the Corinthians, whether it wer lawfull to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a wife, but whether it were expedient, as their ſtate was then, to be entangled with the bonds of mariage. Saint Hierome doth reaſon after this ſorte againſt them, who did attribute to muche vnto matrimonye. <hi>Si bonum eſt mulierem non tangere, ergo malum eſt ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gere,</hi> If it be good not to touch a wyfe, then it is euyl to touche one, ſince that good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll be contrarie.</p>
                     <p>This argument ſaint Auguſtine thus refuteth,<note place="margin">In Epiſtola ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſus Hiero. de medio inter bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>num &amp; malum</note> who had read the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicaments of Ariſtotle, ſaying: ther are ſome thinges indifferent, whych are neither good nor euil, as for to wipe the noſe, or to ſpit.

Yf that in the words of Hierome <hi>malum &amp; bonum</hi> good and euil be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a like in both places, his argument is good, according to the queſtion propoſed of the Corinthians. Yf it be commodious not to mary a wyfe, for the burden of cares, and the bonds of affinitye, then is it vncommodious to mary. As if one ſhould be demaunded, when a man ſhoulde enter into along iourney, and ſhal paſſe by many theuiſh places, whether it be good to take mony with him, &amp; ſhould anſwer it is good not to cary mony, it doth well follow, therfore it is euyll to cary money. For that which here
<pb facs="tcp:7195:100"/> is contrary vnto good, ſaint Paule a litle after calleth a tribulation and affliction of the fleſh. Neither doth he ſimply and flatly ſay: It is good to tary and remaine as I am, but it is good for the vrgent neceſsity. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that which is good for the time, and for the preſent ſtate, is not by and by ſimply, and vniuerſally good. In the time of ſaint Paule, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt a great ſort of Ethnickes, ther were but a few Chriſtians, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce it was then more requiſite to abſtaine from mariage: but nowe the ſtate of thinges being altered, it is not onely expedient, but alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſary, for al men of euery degree, whether they be prieſts or laymen, vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or not votaries, eſpecially if they haue not the gift of chaſtity to enter into the honorable ſtate of matrimony. This place of ſaint Paule may be expounded alſo after this ſort: It is lykely, that the falſe Chriſtians ende<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoured them ſelues to make all men afraid of taking a wife, by reherſing many incommodities of wedlocke: and contraryly to perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue ſinglye, for the commodities belonging thereto, as in tyme paſt alſo the Monkes and Prelates being defenders of the Romiſh chaſtity, wer wont to do. But the anſwer of the Apoſtle is contayned in twoo partes.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt part he teacheth, that it is good for all men if they maye, to abſtaine from women.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond part he addeth a correction, bicauſe that the imbecillity of the fleſhe, is a let vnto many men, they ought not to deſpiſe the lawfull remedy ordayned by God.</p>
                     <p>There are many thinges to be obſerued in this place. Firſt this word <hi>bonum</hi> in Greke <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, is vſed for commodious, quiet, honeſt, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt, and for <hi>bonum,</hi> which is contrary, to vice and euyll. He maketh therfore a falſe argument, which diſputeth after this ſorte: If it be good not to touch a woman, it is euyl therefore to touche a woman, where as good and euyl are contrary.</p>
                     <p>But Paule onely ſheweth what is expedient, bicauſe of the troubles and cares which commonly married men haue. For it was ſayde vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy, bicauſe of the tempeſtes of warre to come, <hi>Noli vxorem ducere,</hi> marry no wyfe, not becauſe it was an offence, but bicauſe it was vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, then to marry. VVherefore there can bee nothing els gathered out of the words of Paule, but that it is expedient for a man not to be cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pled wyth a wyth, if he can be without her.</p>
                     <p>Euen as if a man ſhould ſay: It is good not to eate nor drinke, nor ſleepe: he wyll not condemne meate, drinke, and ſleepe, as thinges hurtfull, but bicauſe ſo much goeth from the ſpirite, how muche more is geuen vnto them He meaneth that we ſhould be more happy, if being free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things, we could wholy geue our ſelues vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7195:100"/> Therfore bicauſe ther are in matrimonye manye impedimentes, by the which a man is letted &amp; troubled, by this reaſon it wer good not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. VVherfore this propoſition muſt be indefinite, where as it cannot be true in al kindes of men. The which is plaine in the firſt man Adam: for this propoſition could not agree vnto him, neither can it be ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who either burne or liue incontinently, whom Paule doth commaund to marry. Therfore he correcteth this propoſition, leaſt anye man ſhoulde iudge euill of matrimony. But bicauſe there ſemes to be a contrariety in theſe words of Paule, with the wordes of Chriſt, wher he ſaith,<note place="margin">Gene. cap, 2</note> it is not good for a man to lacke his wife. Theſe places maye eaſely be reconciled, if that we can diſtinguiſh betwene the pure ordinaunces of God, and the puniſhments of ſynne, which afterward folowed. For whatſoeuer euil &amp; incommodity is in mariage, that commeth of the breaking of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements. According to this diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: At the beginning it was good to haue a wife without any exception, but now it is good in ſuch ſort, that ſorrow is ioyned with pleaſure, by the curſe of God.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a childiſh gloſe, to interprete the huſband of one wife, to be the paſtor of one church. The Apoſtle doth ſimplye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, that a biſhop haue not twoo wiues together at one time, as certaine of the Iewes, and alſo of the Gentiles, being newly conuerted, then had, which was a ſuſpicion of much vnchaſtitye, and great wantonnes. Therfore (ſaith Paule) let a biſhop be the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of one wife. It maketh no matter, whether he marry twiſe or thriſe, one after an other, or whether he do marry mayde or widow, ſo that he haue but one at one time. And here may you ſee that Poligamia is condemned of Paule by name, which Poligamie was then amogeſt the Iewes counted almoſt lawful: but Paule wil haue this ſpot far from a biſhop or prieſt.</p>
                     <p>Note alſo, that he maketh mencion of an huſband, leaſt through ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, matrimony ſhould be forbidden to the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as it happened afterward moſt vngodly, and moſt vnlawfully. And truly there is no doubt, but that the holye ghoſt here woulde meete and come agaynſt this diabolical ſuperſtition, as though he had ſaid: biſhops &amp; miniſters of the Goſpel, are not to be enforced to ſingle life, but much more it behoueth the godly to marrye. But yet he to whom it is geuen of God to leade a ſingle and pure life, is not to be reiected, but the more to be beloued. It is written, that euery man ſhoulde haue his owne wyfe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7</note> to
<pb facs="tcp:7195:101"/> flee fornication.<note place="margin">Heb. 13</note> Alſo it is better to marry, then to burne. Furthermore, wedlocke is honorable, and a bed vndefiled among al men, yet this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be excepted (except one haue the ſingular gift of continencie.) VVherfore, it was moſt tirannical to interdict mariage to ſpiritual me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea, although they liued moſt vnpurely and filthily, as Gratianus &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine biſhops after him, haue decreed againſt all lawes, both of God and man, contrary to cuſtome and to nature. Siricius endeuoured to breake the mariage of ſpiritual men in Spaine, ſo did Gregory in Sicilia, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other attempted the ſame in Germany. But the biſhops of Anguſta, of Magunce, and of Curia, did alwaies gainſay and reſiſt the edict &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Hildebrand, and did alwaies permit and ſuffer ſpirituall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to haue their wiues.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant, what Chriſoſtome doth ſay: who interpreting this place of one wife, which a Biſhop ſhould haue, yet doth adde, that ſome do expound, the huſband of one wife, to be him, which hath onely once al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>redy married, although nowe he haue none. And Chriſoſtome ſeemeth to be in doubt, whether that Paule doth exact and require of a Biſhop, that he haue one wyfe, or els whether he may haue manye at once, after the example of the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>Other do very ſtraightly vrge alſo, that in that age, in the which ther was a rare number of prieſtes, Paul did inſtitut, that no biſhop or prieſt which haue had two wiues, ſhould aſcend to that honour, that is to ſay (as they terme it) if he were <hi>bigamus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some other do affirme, that if anye had a wife before his baptiſme, &amp; had married an other after his baptiſme, the former wife being dead, he ſhould be reſtrained from the miniſtery. But ſaint Hierome to thys doth greatly reclaime and gainſay.</p>
                     <p>One thing is much to be marueiled at, that when Paule doth require here ſo manye noble giftes and dowries in a biſhop, all other clauſes and partes ſet apart, this clauſe (the hauing of one wife) is onely vrged. He that committed inceſt, is admitted, the murtherer may be admitted, the pirate may be admitted, the ſacrileger maye be admitted. Finallye, who not admitted? But he that hath had two wiues, or hath one, or intendeth to haue one, is onely excluded from this honor. O double ignoraunce and blindnes. Marke here, how narrowly and how ſtraightly they vrge ſome thinges, vtterly wincking at other things.</p>
                     <p>It is to be feared, that a great number be made chaſte, more for feare of loſing eccleſiaſticall liuings, then for anye pietye or godlynes, being in feare, leaſt that thing that they haue (if they marrye) ſhoulde bee taken from them.</p>

                        <p>In the counſel called <hi>Synodus Amyrana,</hi> it was decreed, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Deacon was ordered, if the vow of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinency wer required of him, &amp; he do make proteſtation that he wil not liue without a wife, and doth reſiſt their requeſt, &amp; do marry after he is ordered, it is no hinderaunce vnto him,, but that he may lawfully and frely liue in the function of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. Out of the which place we are euidently taught, that it is lawful to marry after orders receiued. Of this Gratianus was not ignoraunt, and therfore he writeth, that concerning that Synode, we muſt reſpect the time and place, for it was kept in the eaſt church, which in ordering of miniſters did not exact of them any promiſe of chaſtity. Concerning the time, he ſaith, that the continency of miniſters, was not than brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church. This Synode was kept vnder Syricius, which liued in the time of Hierome, and Auſten.</p>

                        <p>But I pray you let vs conſider how this tirannie did growe, and what roote it had.

But our holye father (thankes be to god) doth make a cleane diſpatch of them by fagot and fier.</p>
                        <p>Not long after they began to practiſe their cruelty vpon the women,<note place="margin">Diſt. 81. ex quo dam concilio Toletano cap, quidam.</note> with whom the miniſters had contracted, whom they commaunded to be ſold, &amp; to become the ſeruants of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, in the which the prieſt was, which contracted with them And if the biſhop coulde not driue them to that ſeruitude, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the ſame to the prince, or to the lay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.

                        <p>Caietanus the Cardinall doth affirme, that the Pope may diſpence with a prieſt of the weſt Churche to take a wife, after that he is made prieſt, and doth ſay furthermore: <hi>Nec ratione, nec authoritate probatur, quod abſolute loquendo,</hi>

As for the gloſe which doth expound <hi>Copulantur, id eſt, copulatio vtantur,</hi> is vayne and foliſh, for the very order of the text doth ſpeake of the contract of matrimony. Alſo he ſayth, that prieſthood doth not diſſolue nor breake matrimony contracted, whether it be before or after, if we (al other eccleſiaſtical lawes being ſet apart) ſtand onely to thoſe things, which we haue receiued of Chriſt and the Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Caietanus doth alledge out of Thomas, that the church may diſpence in both the vowes, that is, in the ſolemne vow of religious men, and in the vow of ſecular prieſts, ſo that it be for ſome great neceſsity, or ſome vrgent cauſe: &amp; that he proueth by the fact of the Pope, which did diſpence, yea rather compell the king of Aragonia being a Moncke, to forſake hys religion, and to mary a wife, for the diſpoſition &amp; ordering of that kingdome.</p>
                        <p>Yea, and furthermore he doth ſay, that the high Biſhop may in ſome other cauſe (though it be not for publike ciuility, nor eccleſiaſticall vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) with a ſafe conſcience diſpence with a prieſt of the weſt churche to contract matrimony wythout ſynne, and ſayth, that that matrimony is of force.</p>
                        <p>To be ſhort in thys, I could bring a nomber of examples, that prieſtes after they were ordered, did marrye, not onely in other places, but alſo in this realme of England, which were diſpenſed with by the Pope.</p>

                        <p>Now I aſke whether his diſpenſation were lawfull, then I aſke againe, why it is not lawful aſwel for one, as for an other, &amp; why the Pope doth by his lawes reſtrain y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> liberti, &amp; free vſe of thoſe things which god hath permitted &amp; ſet at liberty to al men? If he haue a reſpect to ſome, &amp; not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7195:102"/> to other (for whoſe infirmity God hath prouided a lawfull remedye) he ſheweth him ſelfe, to be a tyraunt, a theefe, and a murtherer of ſoules. If his diſpenſation be vnlawful, than he ſheweth him ſelfe to be a very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, which turneth the rootes of trees vpward, and doth tranſuerte all godly order. But that euerye man hauing not the gift of continencye, may lawfully marry without his diſpenſation, the holy ſpirit doth geue forth in many places of the holy ſcriptures: as in the Epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, in the epiſtle to the Hebrues, in the epiſtle of Paule to Timothie, in the epiſtle ſent to Tite, and in other places. As for the vow which they do ſo greatly vrge, is ſoone refelled. If chaſtity be the gift of God, what nedeth anye vowe of that which is alreadye geuen? If it be not the gift of God, than the vow is wicked, blaſphemous, and contrary to the worde of God. For what is he, that wyll preſume to promiſe that, which he is not able to performe?</p>
                        <p>Againe, euerye Chriſtian man ought to be perſwaded, that he is the ſonne of God. For otherwiſe how doth he call God father in his prayers, whoſe ſonne he doth miſtruſt him ſelfe to be? Therfore, if he be Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, why doth he vow himſelfe to God? Is not he that doth vow, in that opinion, that he is not Gods before his vow? And if he be reſolued that he is Gods ſonne, let him knowe, that he cannot vow that thing vnto God which was Gods before. Thoſe things which thou dooſt vow, either they be commaunded of God, or not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. If they be commaunded, why doeſt thou vow thoſe things which thou art bound to do? Doth the ſonne vow to accompliſh his fathers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, or is he bound to doo it? If they be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, whye doeſt thou inuent a proper worſhippinge of God of thine own head, as though the holy ghoſt had not ſufficientlye taught by the holy ſcriptures, by what meanes God woulde be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped? Bernard doth call his votarye life, a loſt life. But I ſhall hereafter make more ful anſwer to all obiections of votaries and vowes.</p>
                        <p>VVher they ſay, that the apoſtles and other, did put away their wiues, after they were made prieſts, let vs ſomwhat examine this cauſe.

                        <p>This text is of diuers diuerſly interpreted. Some do ſay, that as certein women did folow and ſerue Chriſt, which followed him out of Galile, ſo did certayne godly, honeſt and rich Matrones follow the Apoſtles, which Matrones dydde miniſter of their goodes vnto the Apoſtles, that they might more expeditely apply the preaching of the Goſpell.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note>Of this minde is ſaint Ambroſe, ſaint Auſten, and Chriſoſtome. Other do vnderſtand this ſentence of the wiues of the Apoſtles. Of this mynde is ſaint Clement an old writer, whoſe wordes Euſebius recordeth in the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical hiſtory, which be theſe: <hi>Paulus quidem vxorem habuit, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tamen, vt Petrus &amp; alii, minime circumduxit.</hi> Paule had his wife, whom notwithſtanding hee led not about, as Peter and others did. Ignatius alſo in one of his epiſtles, doth teſtifie Paule to haue had his wife.</p>
                        <p>Now I aſke: whether better credite be to be geuen to Ambroſe, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, Hierome, and Chriſoſtome, or els to Clement and Ignatius, who ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Apoſtles time? Let other iudge.</p>
                        <p>Valla, a man of aſharpe iudgement, bringeth in a reaſon, by the which he ſeemeth to conuince, theſe wordes of Paule, to be vnderſtande of the wiues of the Apoſtles. His words be theſe: <hi>Satis fuiſſet dicere ſororem cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumducendi, neque addendum erat</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>quis enim ignorat ſorores eſſe mulieres? &amp;c.</hi> It had bene ſufficient to ſay, to leade about a ſiſter, &amp; not to adde a woman or wife, for who doth not knowe ſiſters to be women: For there was neuer any ſiſter found, which was man, but contrariwiſe euery wife is not a ſiſter, bicauſe an infidel in wedlocke, may be a wyfe: but bicauſe ſhee is not of one religion with her huſbande, ſhe cannot be called a ſiſter. Therefore it behoued Paule, when he named a woman or wife, to adde to, a ſiſter, that therby it might be vnderſtand, the Apoſtles wiues, which were led about, to haue bene Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>To this argument of Valla, two other argumentes maye be coupled, the one may be brought of the ſignification of this word <hi>circumducendi,</hi> to leade about. For this word cannot be vnderſtand of them, which do fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of their own accord. For theſe honeſt matrones, whereof ſaint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe ſpeaketh, were ſaid in the Goſpel to haue folowed Chriſt from Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile, that they might miniſter vnto them, and not to haue bene led about. For they are counted to leade about women, which haue power ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the huſbands ouer their wiues, and maiſtreſſes ouer their maides.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Paule in this place doth contende, that he gaue place to hys own right and intereſt, leaſt he ſhould burden the church, in taking co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes &amp; charges of the church toward his finding. But if rich women had folowed him, and had miniſtred vnto him of their goods, truly the church had not therwith bene burthened, but rather relieued &amp; eaſed. For that which the Churche was bound to doo, thoſe Matrones being thereabout ſhould haue done.</p>

For vpon a certaine daye, he ſent vnto his pondes for fiſhe, and when he ſaw ſixe thouſand childrens heads drawen out of the ſame, being ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a very inward and earneſt repentaunce, did muche lament it, and confeſsing the decree which he made for ſingle life to be the cauſe of ſo great ſlaughter, did purge the ſame, as I ſayd, with the woorthy fruit of repentaunce, and vtterly condemning his decree, did praiſe the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell of the Apoſtle, ſaying: It is better to marrye, then to burne.

I truly vtterly perſuade my ſelfe, that to be verified in thoſe fathers, whiche Chriſt in the Prophet doth threate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the diſpiſers of his word.

                        <hi>&amp; obſtruxit oculos veſtros quin &amp; prophaetas &amp; praecipuos veſtros videntes operuit.</hi> Make your ſelues dull and wonder: they are blind, and do blind others: they are dronck, but not with wine: they ſtagger, but not by ſtrong drinke. For the Lord hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered you, with the ſprite of ſlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, and hath ſhut vp your eyes, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes alſo and your chief ſeers hath he couered &amp;c. VVho at any tyme, which hath had but a taſt of Gods worde, did euer affirme, that to be God, which the image doth teach: and that to be worſhipped in ſpirite, whiche is ſene in the image? O ſhameleſnes. VVhat other thing can a man ſee in an image, but matter and forme? The forme of an image doth repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent a man, hath therfore God a ſhape and membres like a corruptible man? why therfore were the Anthropomorphites condemned of hereſie? The matter of an image is either gold, ſiluer, ſtone, or woode, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time earth &amp; clay: but who would ſay, that God is either like vnto earth, a ſtone, woode or metall? how therfore is that God which the image doth teach? Agayne if he be to be worſhipped in the minde, which is ſeen in the image, then ſome earthly thing is to be worſhipped. For we ſee nothing in an image, but that which is earthly and corruptible. By this it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:105"/> that blind buſſardes haue gone farre out of the way, definyng and conſtitutyng that whiche is agaynſt true religion and the infinite and vnmeaſurable maieſtie of God. Saint Paul is cleane contrary agaynſt them,<note place="margin">Act. 17,</note> ſaying: Synce that we are the generation of God, we ought not to thincke, that the Godhead is like either vnto golde, or ſiluer, or ſtone grauen by arte, or inuention of man. Neither do they onely offend againſt the diuine Scripture, but alſo they haue forgotten what the holy fathers before haue written. For Athanaſius agaynſt the gentiles writeth thus: If they thincke God to be of a corporall ſhape, geuing vnto him handes, feete, necke, breſte and all other members like a man, ſee vnto what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety they are broughte, whiche are not afraide to haue ſo fonde a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of God. For then it would neceſſarily folowe, that it ſhould be thought to ſuffer all thinges pertayning to the imbecillity of the body, if it be circumſcribed after the maner of the bodies of men. It will folow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that it may be cut and deuided, and wholly periſhe. But who is ſo mad to thincke, that thoſe things happen vnto God? for theſe things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per onely vnto earthly bodies. For God is without a body and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, immortall and euerlaſting, who hath nede of nothing. But theſe thinges are corruptible, and the lineamentes of their bodies hath nede of mans aide and arte. For we ſee them oftentimes to be renewed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are olde, and that which either the length of time, rayne, or any liuyng beſt by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce haue deſtroyed, to be made new againe by mans helpe. But Lactantius writeth more plainly of this matter,<note place="margin">lib. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>am. cap, 2</note> ſaying: After y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be preſent with vs, we haue not now any nede of the image of him. I aſke this queſtion, whether if a man continually behold the image of him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is abſent, and is gone into farre countreis, that he may take co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of him being away, ſhal this man appeare to be in his wits, if he ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new ſtill in beholding the image of him who is now returned agayne and there preſent, and would rather enioy the ſight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe? no truly. For the image of a man then ſemeth neceſſary when the man is abſent and far of, but it is ſuperfluous when he is preſent. But the image of God is alway ſuperfluous and vayne, whoſe ſpirite &amp; God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head being euery where diffuſed &amp; ſpread, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer be abſent. VVhat ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be more plaine &amp; perſpicuous againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decree of theſe fathers? The ſame author hath wordes not vnlike to theſe, ſaying. But they are afraide, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all their Religion ſhould be voyde, if they ſhould ſee nothing whiche they might worſhip, and therfore they ordein images: which bycauſe they are the images of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, they are dead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, for they are deſtitute of all ſenſe &amp; feling. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of God which liueth for euer, ought to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſible &amp; liuely. If an image toke his name of likelines, how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe images be iudged like vnto God, which cannot moue or feele any thing, therfore
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7195:105"/> that is not the image of God, whiche is made with mans handes, of golde or ſtone, or of any like matter, but man him ſelfe is the image of God, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he feleth and moueth, and doth many actions. &amp;c. And there is no cauſe, why our aduerſaries ſhould tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſferre the ſtate from God vnto the ſaintes: for as concerning the pictures and images of God, they are mani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſtly found to be in a wicked error. Now as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the images of the ſaintes, let the images of the ſaintes tell, whether they be the images of the ſoules, or of the bodies. The ſoules, bycauſe they are without a body, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be expreſſed in images. For we beleue, that the ſoules liue in felicitie with God in heauen, and the bodies rot in the earth, vntill the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this cauſe you will ſay, that you repreſent the bodies by bodily images. But how is it, that they do not behold and worſhip liuely bodies, rather then the ſhadowes of bodies rotten? do not theſe fooliſh men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that if the images could feele or moue, they would worſhip their makers, of whom they were poliſhed and decked? who if they had not ſo bene formed, they had remayned vndoubtedly a rude ſtone or blocke, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore is, in a maner the father of images, by whoſe handes they were framed, and by whom they began to haue their ſhape, figure and beautie. And therfore he is better that made them, than they whiche are made. And no man doth worſhip the image makers, wherfore Seneca wrote worthyly in his mortall books agaynſt the gentils. They worſhip the ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges of the goddes, they humble them ſelues vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bowing their knees, they fall proſtrate before them, they ſit or ſtand by them the whole day, they offer rewardes, and burne ſacrifice vnto them. Finally, wheras they ſo much wonder, at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet notwithſtanding the caruers that made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, deſpiſe and contemne them. The Chriſtians likewiſe, wonder at images, they beholding them, prayſing and extolling the curious worckemanſhip in them, do in the meane time diſpiſe the workemanſhip of God. For very fewe do conſider the beauty and comelines of the things in the world, &amp; do ſet forth the prayſe of their maker, as it is worthy. They ar occupied in the beholding of the fond &amp; trifling toies of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wheras the diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dence hath exhibited more arte, cunning, and wiſedom to be ſene and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued of vs in the litle Emmet or in a ſmall flower of the field, or in one leafe of a tree or herbe, then we can find in all the pictures or images of all the paynters and caruers, being neuer ſo finely wrought. And theſe fooliſh fathers, be not aſhamed, to ſend the ſimple people vnto the vaine and fond workes of mens handes. Let them therfore beleue theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, vnto whom it is a pleaſure and delight to erre, ſtomble, and to fall. They which are wiſe, beleue the Scriptures, and therfore they beleue,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:106"/> that theſe Counſels were mad &amp; out of the way. For the Counſels which were after gathered by the authoritie of the Church of Rome, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, yea rather more fond and fooliſhe. But they ſay, that in all theſe general counſels the hereſie of not worſhipping of images, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: For now they boldly and raſhly call that hereſie, which hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in the Church of Chriſt was called <hi>Orthodoxum,</hi> that is, of ſound and right religion. Surely they haue in their Councels defined and decreed thoſe things, which are contrary to the law of God, which neither was ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerued of the Apoſtles, nor the Apoſtles diſciples, nor can be ſhewed or proued by any Scriptures. Let them therfore ſee by what ſpirite, or how catholikly they haue intruded into the Churche of God the vſe of images. Saint Auſten writeth,<note place="margin">In catalo. 8 hereſeon</note> that there was a certaine woman named Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, of the ſect of the Carpocratianes, which worſhipped the image of Ieſus and of Paul, of Homer, and of Pythagoras, humbling her ſelf vnto them, and offring incenſe. VVhat will our aduerſaries ſay here? Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina is ſet in the Cataloge of heretiques, bicauſe ſhe was a felow vnto the Carpocratians, &amp; worſhipped y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> images of Ieſus and Paul, and the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the chief Poetes and Philoſophers. Ye call vs heretiques bycauſe we oppugne the images of the ſaintes, and teach with all the Catholiques and faithfull, that they are not to be worſhipped, that no kinde of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be done to them, no incenſe to be layd before them. Lactantius alſo iudged, that there was no religion, whereſoeuer images were ſet vp. VVe are called the ſubuerters of religion, bycauſe we endeuour to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the deſtruction &amp; peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of all religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſire to know the wordes of Lactantius, they are theſe: There can be nothing greater then man, but that which is aboue man, therfore God is aboue man, and not vnder man: neither is he ſet in the loweſt region, he is to be ſought in the higheſt place. VVherfore it is not doubtfull, but that whereſoeuer any image is, there is no religion. For if religion do conſiſte only in diuine things, and there is no diuine thing but that which is heauenly, therfore all images ar without religion. For there can be nothing celeſtial in that thing which is of the earth.<note place="margin">Libr, ſuſti. cap. 19.</note> And for this cauſe the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and catholike Church did vtterlye auoyde all images. For we can bring proofe out of one Aelius Lampridius, an Ethnicke writer, that the primitiue Church did abhorre images,<note place="margin">In vita imper Alex, Seueri</note> for Lampridius writeth thus: Alexander Seuerus (ſayth he) aſcended into the Capitolle the ſeuenth day after he had ben in the Citie, he frequented the Churches, and he would haue a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto Chriſt, and receyue him among the goddes. The which thing al ſo Adrianus is ſayd to haue minded, who commanded Churches in euery Citie to be builded without images, which at this day, bycauſe they haue
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7195:106"/> no goddes, are called Adriani, that is the Churches of Adrian, which he was ſayd to haue made for this purpoſe, but he was forbidden of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king counſell of their goddes, learned, that all men would become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, if that ſhould come to paſſe, and that all Churches would be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Hetherto Lampridius: manifeſtly declaryng, that it was the vſe of the chriſtians to haue no images in their churches. This thing Seuerus ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to haue don, &amp; Adrianus alredy had builded ſuch churches eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye where, that he myght geue an occaſion to induce the manner of the chriſtians, except the deuils had perſwaded the contrary, that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhould be ſet vp in the churches, leaſt their religion ſhould decay. If our aduerſaries refuſe the teſtimonie of an Ethnick man, let them heare Eraſmus Roterodamus, writing in this ſort: vntil the time of Hierome,<note place="margin">In Catacheſino,</note> the chriſtians were of a good and ſound religion, who ſuffred no image in the church, nor painted, nor graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor wrought, no not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of Chriſt which way as I thincke, to ſtay the hereſie of the Anthropomorphites. But after that, the vſe of images crept into the churches by litle &amp; litle. Thus much <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> Saint Hierome liued almoſt. <hi>400.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In proemie, lib, 3, continent, in Amos,</note> yeares after the Natiuitie of Chriſt, as he him ſelfe doth witnes. VVherfore it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the primatiue church of Chriſt was without images by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace almoſt of <hi>500.</hi> yeres. Therfore it may not hereafter ſeme greuous vnto vs to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned of hereſie, &amp; blamed with the primitiue church. Thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſt therfore (ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle reader) how vnworthily and without a cauſe, our aduerſaries endeuour to condemn vs of hereſie, wheras it manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth, all our endeuour and labour to tende to this end, that (all heatheniſhneſſe and hereſie beyng taken away) we may bryng in agayn, and reſtore the auncient orders of the Apoſtles, and of the Apoſtolicke Churches.</p>
                     <p>Now will I declare the cauſe, why this councell, and by whom this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell was called and gathered. There was one Irene, wife vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Leo the .iiij. of that name, who was the ſonne of Conſtantinus the fift, being ſonne to Leo the third, whom they called in deriſion <hi>I conomachus,</hi> that is to ſay a wreſtler and fighter againſt Images, &amp; called Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine his ſonne <hi>Copronimus,</hi> bicauſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was chriſtened, he defiled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fonte with his dung. But other do ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when he was oftentimes waſhed of his nurſe, he would ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle his own doung with his hands, and therfore he was called <hi>Copronimus.</hi> Theſe two Emperours Leo &amp; Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine his ſonne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded images to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the church, and to be vtterly defaced.</p>
                     <p>Now this Leo the .iiij. Irenes huſband, begat a ſonne of her, who alſo was called Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinus. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Leo was dead, &amp; Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine his ſonne very yong, Irene thempres toke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thempire. Vnder this Irene, images wer reſtored into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches. She alſo bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied
<pb facs="tcp:7195:107"/> with a great garde vpon the feaſt of the Natiuitie of our Lord, went into the great church of Conſtantinople, and reſtored agayne the crowne of golde adourned with precious ſtones, which her huſband Leo, had before taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence. At this time in the country of Thracia, when a certayn man had digged vp a certaine piece of ground, there was found a certain coffin of ſtone, in the whiche was buryed a certayne man, and a certayne plate or peece of Braſſe was founde vpon the dead man hauyng theſe words written in it: <gap reason="foreign">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of this Irene a councell of .iij. hundreth and fifty Biſhops was celebrate at the towne of Nice. The cauſe of this Synode was this. One Paulus was then Patriarke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Conſtantinople, he being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a feruent ſicknes, left the cure &amp; charg of his church, &amp; lay in hys bed, as it had ben a man in diſpayr, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thempreſſe Irene made her repayre, and comforting him, did inquire the cauſe of his departing from the Churche. To whom he aunſwered, ſaying, I would to God, O Queene I had neuer entered into this ſee, which being oppreſſed with Tiranny, hath in it ſo many diuiſions, and none obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But when he would vtter no more of his minde vnto the Queene, ſhe ſent vnto him the wiſeſt men of the Senate, which required of him the cauſe of his penſifnes. Vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he anſwered, except ther be a generall councell called to redreſſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; to vnite all Churches together, all things would come to wracke and confuſion. To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Senators ſayd agayn. VVhy diddeſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thy prince, when thou cameſt to thy See, that images ought not to be worſhipped. That thing ſaith he, cauſed the madnes of the rulers &amp; your crueltie. So ſpeaking theſe wordes, with a few mo, he departed out of this lyfe. After him was choſen one Taraſius to be Patriarke, but he could not be conſtrained, neither by prayers, nor by manacies to take vpon him this dignity, except they would promiſe a general councell, which beyng grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, he became Patriark went to Rome to Adrianus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhop to haue confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F Plato I haue written before, what he was: yet I thought good in this place to note two thinges. The firſt is of <hi>Idea,</hi> whiche Plato doth call the firſte ſhape or intelligence of thinges. VVhiche Plato denieth to be gendred and made, but doth ſay, that they be alwayes and are conteyned in reaſon and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandyng. Theſe were named firſt Ideae by Plato. And they be the eternall exemplars of thoſe thinges, whiche be naturally made: they be immortall, immutable, and inuiolable. And that the matter may be made more playne, it is nedefull beſide all men, to vnderſtand and conceaue in reaſon and vnderſtanding, an other certaine man, and beſide al horſes, to conceaue an other horſe: and beſides other beaſtes, to conceaue a beaſt vnbegotten. And as of one ſeale there be made many printes of the ſame ſeale, ſo of one man there commeth ſix hundred thouſand men. This is the <hi>Idea,</hi> of Plato, from whom Ariſtotle doth diſſent, and doth thincke, that ther be no ſuch Ideae. If you will more of theſe Ideae, red S. Auguſtin, who writeth of them at large in diuerſe and ſondrie places.</p>
                     <p>Secondly although the Academickes (of whiche ſecte Plato was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) were coumpted more modeſt then other Philoſophers, yet not all whiche were called by the name of Academickes, did obſerue the rule of modeſtie, but ſome of them did ſhewe forth both their great follye and their great errour. For what is more fooliſhe, then to haue the name of a Philoſopher, and to doubt and wauer in euery thyng, and to haue the certaynty of nothing? for they that doubt of all things, are very far both from faith and knowledge. Man is more noble then all other beaſtes by reaſon and vnderſtanding, but in certaine ſenſes, he is inferiour vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine beaſtes. For the beaſt called Linx, is of a quicker ſight then ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Sowe of a quicker hearing, the Dog of a perfecter ſent and ſmel, the Ape of a better taſt, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spider of a readyer touching. &amp;c. But for as much as man doth excell all beaſtes by the power of diſcerning and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, who doth not coumpt that man more brutiſh then beaſtes, whiche thincketh him ſelfe to haue no reaſon to iudge things, and none vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to ſauor things. In ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do perceaue, certaine brute beaſtes almoſt to embrace the image of reaſon. For the dog hath his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; is mindfull of the benefites done vnto him: he knoweth his maiſter with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is familiar, and as though he were enobled with ſome wit and rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, he returneth to his maiſters houſe, when he hath loſt him, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the dog be <hi>.300.</hi> miles from his home, as I my ſelfe knew a dog of a certayne mans in Cornowall dwelling almoſt by the mount, being loſt in Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beyond the temmes came home agayne a fourthnight before hys
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7195:108"/> maiſter came out of London. The Camell is very mindefull of iniuries and wrongs done vnto him: the Vnicorne doth know the integrity of his virgin femall, in ſo much that he is delighted onely with the embracings of her, and none other. All other beaſtes haue a marueilous delight in the ſwete ſauour, that commeth from the Panther, and in beholding of him. Therfore feling by the ſwete ayre where the Panthers haue their reſort, thither will all beaſtes come. The fiſhes being in the deepe ſtreames, doe come to the ſhew of gold, wherupon that prodigall and laſciuious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Nero did fiſh with golden nettes. VVhat nede many wordes. <hi>Torua Leona lupu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſequitur, lupus ipſe capellam.

So after this ſort is euery beaſt drawen and led with his plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure, which cannot be, if they ſhould doubt of their affections. They ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which doubt at all things, by what temeritie or by what impudencie do they chalenge the profeſsion of Philoſophie? Looke more for the folly of this ſect in Saint Auſten, and in Cicero, who both with ſtrong reaſons do diſpute againſt theſe kindes of Academickes.</p>

And many of the holy fathers did often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the readers of their bookes, not to geue honor to their writings, which is due onely to the holy Scriptures. If this iudgement which Paule would to be obſerued, had bene warely and wiſely practiſed in the Churche, we ſhould not haue had at this day ſo many fooliſh traditions and wicked decrees of the Biſhop of Rome. But this ſeruitude wherin the Churche hath bene lately wrapped, came partly through ouer much flatteryng of the Biſhop of Rome, and partly through his violent tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by the whiche he decreed it to be an horrible ſacrilege, to iudge and make inquiſition of his reſcriptes and conſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, ſluggiſhenes and idlenes hath ſo inuaded the mynds of men, that they had rather truſt to other mens iudgementes, then to their owne. But if God would haue vs to be iudge of his Prophetes, why may not the like be done of the Pope and his decrces. Yet men ought not here to take an occaſion of contention, and to vexe and to diſturbe the church. For Paule doth not ſay, let other make altercation, let other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende, but (ſayth he) let other iudge. It is one thing to heare him, that teacheth, and to vnderſtande and to iudge, and an other thyng by the ſpirite of contention to call all thinges (be they neuer ſo well ſpoken) into queſtion and disputation. For to iudge, it nedeth not nor behoueth, that the hearer doo gayneſaye the teacher in the open congregation: but it is ſufficient if he iudge in his harte of thoſe thinges whiche he heareth. And when the congregation is diſſolued, if he deſire any thing, to aſke it of him, when they be alone, for except this modeſtie be kepte and obſerued, we ſhould looke for nothing els but a vayne, hurteful, and vncomely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation in the Churche.</p>

He did many miracles while he liued, and was like vnto a burning fier, in ſo much that his wordes burned like a torche. This Prophet firſt of al came vnto Achab, and ſpake vnto him in the name of the lord, for he had forſaken the commaundements of the Lord and folowed Baal, and he foreſhewed him the great drouth and famine, which ſhould folow and continew for thre yeares in Samaria. VVhiche when he had told him, he fled, and hid himſelfe thre yeares in a caue by a riuer, where continually euery day a rauen came &amp; brought him meat. After when the riuer wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed dry, he departed into the citie of Sarepta, where he was nouriſhed of a certaine poore widow, during the time of all the drouth. And after it chaunced, that the ſonne of that woman whiche gaue him meate, dyed, who had no more children, and he was reſtored vnto life agayne by the prayer of the Prophet Helias, who as ſome ſay, was the Prophet Ionas. After thre yeares ended Helias prayed in the ſight of Achab the kyng, and there came forthwith, aboundaunce of rayne and hayle from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

From the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce returning vnto the country of Iewes, and finding Helizeus at the plough and twelue other, he caſt his cloke vpon him, and began to Prophecie.

The Empire of Aſsiria vtterly fell and was deſtroyed vnder Sardanapalus, a moſt laſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciuious and diſſolute king, but it was mightely reſtored, and repayred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by one Nabuchadonozor Priſcus, who was father to the great Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>buchadonozor, and euen then alſo it beganne to be called both the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chaldea, and the kingdome of Babilon, not manye yeares before Manaſſes (graundfather to Ioſias the king) was taken of the Babiloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Therfore, when the Iewes ſaw the prowes and ſtrength of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to grow more &amp; more (when Ioſias raygned) they did greatly feare their might and power, and did by diuers and ſundrye waies conſult be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them ſelues, both of the wealth of their kingdome, and alſo of the preſeruation of the church. One was in one minde, and an other in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truſted to one thing, &amp; that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truſted to an other thing, and ſo the mindes of the whole people were diuers, and did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly varry: but the bounteous Lorde in theſe their doubtfull cares, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in very good ſeaſon, and helpeth at a pinch. He doth exhibite vnto them certaine good counſels, and ſendeth vnto them the prophet Ieremy to inſtruct them, how they might be deliuered out of theſe daungers, &amp; how they might preſerue their kingdome whole, and kepe the integritye of religion. Firſt, he doth greatly vrge all eſtates and perſons, of what age ſo euer they were, to confirme themſelues to the good counſel of god, and (leauing al their vaine hopes) to truſt onely to the Lord God, to put away their corrupt maners, and to faſhion them ſelues to the wil of God. There wer ſeuen thinges, in the which ſpecially they did put their affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce. Firſt in the temple, in interceſsion of ſaintes, in manifolde ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in mans wiſdome, in the large promiſes of falſe prophets, in mutuall conſent, finally in the aboundance of riches. Al theſe things doth the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet moſt ſtrongly confute, and doth vtterly manace vnto them a moſt ſure and horrible deſtruction, except they would amend in due time.</p>
                     <p>And I beſech you, what haue our men done of late daies? Haue not the counſels bene their refuge? Haue they not there often conſulted how to preſerue the church and the common wealth? And what do their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels bring forth? Nothing els but Cockatrice egges. For al the counſels which haue bene aſſembled vnder the Romiſh biſhops, theſe. <hi>500</hi> yeares, haue diſcourſed and bebated nothing but theſe clauſes following. Firſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpe al the Popes aduerſaries, that is (as they cal them) heretickes. To make reformation of ceremonies in al churches To haue gorgious altars, great nomber of Maſſes, fine chaunting and ſinging, to haue images in euery corner of the church, to diſſolue and breake the lawfull ſtate of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage of the ſpirituall miniſters, to haue ſumptuous and rich copes, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, banner clothes, baſons, cruets, and what not? Finally, to ſet forth an army againſt the Turkes, to wynne the city of Hieruſalem out of theyr hands. But what commodity and profit haue iſſued from ſuch counſels, hiſtories, time, and dayly experience can declare. But for the extirping of idolatry, for the purity of preaching Gods word, for the right admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſacraments, for the cleane life of the clergy in putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their hoores, and marying lawfull wyues, no reformation. Theſe things be bugges to them, with theſe thinges they wyll not meddle, leaſt theyr glory ſhould be defaced.</p>
                     <p>But the prophet here doth commaund the Iewes to heare the counſell of God, and to redreſſe their liues, and to forſake their hyll alters, theyr idoles, and their hie groues, which in dede they did in part, but not in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7195:111"/> whole. For their corrupt maners remained vncorrected, and the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Baal, was not vtterly aboliſhed and left. The prophet ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was commaunded, to ſtand in the gate, and to preach to the people. Some write, that ther were in the city ſeuen gates, three on the North ſide, thre on the South ſide, and one which was moſt famous on the Eaſt ſide, in the which the prophet is reported to haue ſtand, and to haue ſaid thus: Bicauſe ye come to the temple to woorſhip the Lord, heare what the Lord ſpeaketh to you. And here by the way note, that although God be in euery place, and is included in no place, and ought to be woorſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in euery place, in ſpirite and truth, yet ſpeciallye and ſingularlye he ought to be worſhipped in the temples, and in the holye congregacions, which temples were inſtituted and ordained for that ende: that is, that worſhip and honor might be geuen vnto God openly, and in ſome certain place, as eccleſiaſticall diſcipline doth require. Out of the wordes of the prophet may be learned alſo, what all faithfull ought to do, when they come to the temples. <hi>Nempe vt adorent dominum,</hi> forſoothe that they worſhip the Lord. To worſhip the Lord (I ſay) and not dead ſtockes: to worſhip the Lord, and not to garniſh images with rich coates, with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and gold, with burning tapers and candels.</p>
                     <p>After this, the prophet doth ſhew them the whole counſell of God, ſaying: <hi>Emendate vias veſtras, &amp; ſtudia veſtra.</hi> Mende your waies and your ſtudies. By waies and ſtudies, he vnderſtandeth althoughts &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, and (as Hierome ſaith) al their ſayings and doings, whych be a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mended &amp; reformed, when we omit thoſe things which god forbiddeth, and do thoſe things which God commaundeth. But the moſt part of men do contemne or litle ſet by, this wholſome counſell of God, and doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of other inuentions. Now foloweth the vtility and profit of this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, which the prophet gaue them. <hi>Et faciam vos habitare in loco iſto,</hi> &amp; I will make you to dwel in this place, that is, you ſhall not be deuoured in battel, you ſhal not be beaten with calamities and miſeries, but you ſhall be happy and bleſſed in your country, out of the which you ſhall neuer depart into captiuities, nor into the lands of your enemies.</p>
                     <p>But bicauſe the fooliſh people tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> toke no great regard of the wholſom counſel of God, bicauſe they had vtterly conceiued vaine hope and truſt in vaine things (as in figures and ſhadowes) the prophet goeth foorth to open their folly, and to refute them, as it is the part of a good teacher, vt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terly to take away thoſe things, which did let and hinder obedience and reformation of life. Ieremy therfore ſayth: <hi>Nolite fidere verbis menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus, dicentes: templum domini, templum domini, templum domini.</hi> That is: Truſt not in lying woords, ſaying: the temple of the Lord, the
<pb facs="tcp:7195:112"/> temple of the Lord, this is the temple of the Lord. He repeateth thys word thre times, to ſignifie the ſure truſt that they had in the temple &amp; in their ſacrifices, as though they ſhould haue ſayd: Is it like, that we ſhould be cut of by the battels of ſtraunge nacions, which haue here with vs the temple of the Lord? Yea, the temple which is the noble woorke of Salomon. VVhich temple hath theſe great promiſes, that is, if there come either battel, famine or peſtilence, yet they ſhal not anoy vs, if we go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the temple to craue pardon. VVho therfore would beleue vs to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed of the Heathen, as the prophets do triflle?</p>
                     <p>In the like madnes are they, which in theſe dayes cry and ſay: Neither Turke nor Saraſen can ouercome vs Chriſtians, for we haue Abbeies of both the ſexes, in the which both men and women do ſerue the Lord, we haue Colleges, we haue temples, in the which ther is ſinging and reading day and night, in the which we haue mattenſing &amp; maſsing, ringing &amp; piping. It cannot be, but God wil heare vs. But let thoſe hipocrites per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them ſelues, that God did not ordaine by his word any ſuch kinde of worſhipping, any ſuch kinde of praying and prating as they vſe.</p>
                     <p>But to the prophet againe. Are ye not aſhamed (ſaith he to the Iewes) being defiled with ſo many horrible ſinnes, to enter into the temple of the Lord, which is called by his name, and conſecrated vnto him, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelues to be deliuered from all maner of calamities, onely for that ye enter into my temple, and are beholders of holy things? And yet notwithſtanding you ſteale, you murther, you be adulterers, you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit periury, you offer incenſe vnto Baal, you follow thoſe Goddes whom you know not. VVhat do you meane? Is my houſe in your eyes nothing els but a den of theues? I know that you reſolue your ſelues, that your doings are hidden, &amp; that with your hipocriſy you may deceiue both God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. You are deceiued, for I know (ſayth God) the very ſecretes of your min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, I vnderſtand al the wicked imaginations of your harts.</p>
                     <p>It ſhalbe beſt to excuſſe and examine certaine ſingular wordes of thys ſentence going before, &amp; ſo to apply the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our erudition and doctrine, with out the which the words of the prophet are not ſo much auailable.</p>
                     <p>The prophet here doth recite certaine receiued &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon kinds of ſin.</p>
                     <p>By theft, he vnderſtandeth fraud, guile, diſceite, vſury, &amp; ſuch other vnlawful and vngodly craftes and meanes.</p>
                     <p>By murther, he vnderſtandeth wrath, hatred, ſtriuings, enuy, ſtripes ſlaughters and vnlawful warres.</p>
                     <p>By adultery, he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth voluptuous luſts, inordinate pleaſures, &amp; al vnclenlynes in mind, word &amp; dede, filthines, fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hooredo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, &amp; ſuche other impurities.

And yet the ſuperſticious and proud Iewes, beyng corrupted with al theſe ſpots, came vnto the temple, and ſtoode without ſhame in the ſight of God, ſaying: Although we haue done al theſe abhominacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yet are we deliuered and made free, onely bicauſe we viſit the temple.<note place="margin">Iere. 7.</note> For if ther be nede of any expiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or purging, we be made cleane by viſiting the temple.

And do ye (ſaith God) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to abuſe my houſe, as theues do their dens?

The abuſe therfore of the temples is, if we perſwade our ſelues to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, if we enter once into the temple, and do no more.

                     <p>The true church therfore ſemeth to be barren, that is, to haue a few diſciples, yea almoſt none, in ſomuch that it ſemeth vtterly to periſh. It hath not thoſe worldly praiſes, thoſe magnificent braueries, which the hipocritical church hath. It hath not theſe corporal commodities, &amp; gaye glitterings, it hath not that great multitude and nomber aſwell of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes as of princes. But as Peninna did moleſt and vexe poore barren Anna, with ſharpe checkes and tauntes: ſo the church of Antichriſt doth lay and heape al maner of opprobries, vpon the true church of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Anna was a prophetiſſe, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aſer, and did with her confeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and teſtimony anſwer vnto Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon, confirming Chriſt to be geuen, and did render thankes vnto the Lord, that Meſsias the redemer was exhibited. If this Anna were .xv. yeares of age when ſhe was married, and lyued <hi>7.</hi> yeares wyth her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band after ſhe was married, and than <hi>.84</hi> in her widowhood, we muſt nedes confeſſe that ſhe was <hi>.106.</hi> yeares old. She might therefore in her youth haue ſene old men, which were familiar with Iudas Machabeus. The Euangeliſt ſaint Luke declareth the genelogy of this chaſt widdow,<note place="margin">Luke, 2</note> ſaying, that ſhe was the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aſer. Thys Anna tooke her name of the thing which ſhe had, that was the grace of the prophetical ſpirite, being called the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7195:113"/> of Aſer, did after a certaine ſecret maner ſignify the bleſſed reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For Aſer betokeneth in the Hebrue toung <hi>beatum,</hi> bleſſed, whereof we reade in Geneſis, when Zilpha the handmaiden of Lia, had borne an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſonne to Iacob, then ſaid Lia: bleſſed am I,<note place="margin">Gen. 30</note> for the daughters wyll bleſſe me, and therfore ſhe called his name Aſer.<note place="margin">Gen. 49</note> And Iacob before he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parted out of this life, bleſſed Aſer, ſaying: his bread ſhall be fat, and he ſhal geue pleaſure for a king. This Anna I ſay, gaue likewyſe teſtimonie of Chriſt. Note here, that Ieſus tooke teſtimony of Zachary the prieſt, of Elizabeth his wife, of the angel, of the ſhepheards of Bethlem, and of the wiſe men of the eaſt, that is, of al perſons, of what ſtate, what age, what ſect ſoeuer they were. Now that nothing might want, Luke doth bring in here the teſtimony of Anna the widow, wherby it maye throughly be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God had ſent his ſon, the ſauiour of the world, into the world.</p>
                     <p>The third Anna was, as Epiphanius and Procopius writeth, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the virgin Mary, yea and the nurſe of Chriſt alſo, as one of them ſaith, ſhe was the daughter of Iſachar, of the tribe of Leui, or as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Damaſcene, ſhe came of the tribe of Iuda, being married vnto one Ioachim of her own tribe. VVhen ſhe had remained barren a certayne time, at the laſt ſhe conceiued &amp; brought forth Mary the mother of god. After Ioachim her huſband was dead, ſhe married Cleophas, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe bare an other daughter called Mary. Cleophas betrothed Mary the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, vnto his brother Ioſeph, and coupled Mary his own daughter, vnto one Alpheus. Of this Mary was borne Iacobus Alpheus, Symon Canane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, and Iudas Thaddeus, who alſo was called Barſabas. VVhen Cleophas was dead, this Anne married the third huſband, whoſe name was Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, of whom ſhe bare the third daughter, called by name Maria Salome: who being married to zebedeus, did beare Iames the greater, and Iohn the Euangeliſt.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rrius (as Epiphanius writeth) was the ſonne of one Ammonius, who being at Antioch, hauing to companion Euſebius of Nicome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dia, heard Lucianus the prieſt and Martyr, of whom he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the holy ſcriptures.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7195:114"/>
                     <p>By what occaſion he came to the dignity of prieſthood at Alexandria, it is not knowen, except that the interpretation of the ſcriptures was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him aboue the other prieſtes, bicauſe he was very expert in the arguments of Dialect, and well exerciſed in ſuch diſciplines. Of the ſtature and habite of his body and minde Epiphanius reporteth thys: He was of a very long ſtature, of a countenaunce ſomwhat ſad, figured lyke a ſuttle Serpent, which could deceiue euerye innocent hart through hys crafty pretence. He alwaies did weare his mantle or robe but halfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one ſide. He was pleaſant in talk, a faire &amp; flattering perſwader, by the which crafts he allured &amp; brought in a ſhort ſpace <hi>.700.</hi> Virgines (which had profeſſed chaſtity) into his ſentence and opinion, beſides <hi>.7.</hi> Prieſtes, and <hi>.12.</hi> Deacons.</p>
                     <p>His hereſy was, that Chriſt concerning the godhead, was not of one ſubſtaunce with the Father, with many other errours. Nicephorus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that one Alexander Baucalis the ſecond Prieſt next vnder Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, the authour of this diſſention, who (diſdaining that Arrius ſhoulde be preferred in honour before him) did caſt this newe doctrine vpon Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, as the authour therof. Saint Hierome doth ſay, that Arrius, Euzoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Diaconus and Achillas the Reader, were authours of this hereſy, but emulation and enuy towards Alexander, Biſhop of Alexandria, ſtirred and moued Arrius to vtter this new doctrine. For he thought hym ſelfe nothyng inferiour in doctrine and learnyng vnto Alexander, for he thought by this meanes to come in eſtimation, and to be in euery mans mouth. Ruffinus wryteth, that other Biſhoppes and Doctours of the Church (who had great delight in ſuttle and crafty queſtions) ſpurred foorth Arrius to this fury. Zonaras doth write, that Origine was the firſt authour of this hereſy, for he was the firſt that affirmed, the onely Sonne of of God to be made, and to be diuers from the nature of God the Father. But theſe thinges lay hidden in papers, couered with ſcilence, &amp; not yet publiſhed, but Arrius brought them foorth into light, preached them openly, drawing many vnto this his impiety, as is ſayd before. Thys his hereſy being deprehended and knowne, Alexander the Byſhoppe did conferre with hym verye familiarlye, endeuouring to wythdrawe hym from hys wicked and bold enterpriſe, but al was in vayn. Therfore he remoued him from the dignity and function of prieſthood. Arrius being thus remoued and confuſed, fled into Paleſtine, and there laboured with flattering and faire meanes to get vnto him, companions to be partakers of his error. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to Nicomedia to his old frend Euſebius, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye gentlye entertayned of him in his houſe, and when hee had remayned ther a good ſpace, he allured Euſebius fully and wholly into hys ſentence:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7195:114"/> And vſing that for a chiefe helpe, he and his companion Euſebius, ſent letters to Alexander. VVhen the fame and talke of Arrius came to the eares of Conſtantinus the Emperour, he much deſiring to heale this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent and heretical contagion, which had infected not onely the city of Alexandria, but alſo many other cities and prouinces beſide, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a generall Counſel to be kept at Nice, in the which Counſell Arrius was conuicted, reiected, and condemned. A certaine Prieſt receiuer of Conſtantia (who was the ſiſter of Conſtantine, and the wife of Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius the tiraunt) fauouring the doctrine of Arrius, talked oftentimes by occaſion vnto Conſtantia of Arrius, excuſing Arrius cauſe, and that he thought not ſo, as was layd to his charge, and that he was vniuſtlye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of the counſell, and ſo had ſoone perſwaded the woman, beyng light of credite. It happened, that this Quene fel into a deadly ſickenes, and the Emperour came to viſit her, ſhe hauing oportunitie, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Prieſt vnto him, as a godly and diligent man, and one that wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed wel to the Empire, and a litle while after ſhe dyed. The Prieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus commended vnto the Prince, beganne not long after to intreat of Arrius cauſe vnto the King, and ſayde, that he was oppreſſed with ſlaunders agaynſt all right and reaſon. Then aunſwered the King, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If Arrius doth conſent and hold with the Synode, I wyll cauſe hym to be reſtored vnto hys own place and dignity at Alexandria.

The biſhoppes, bicauſe they woulde doo nothing contrary to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours minde, did receiue Arrius and his fellowes into their communion and fellowſhip again.

                     <p>Arrius being glad of this iudgement,<note place="margin">Sozo Lib. 2. cap. 27</note> and of the ſucceſſe of his diſsimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and deceit, after the Synode holden at Hieruſalem, was diſſolued, returned into Aegipt.

The Euſebians the next day following, purpoſed to bring in Arrius into the church. Alexander repoſing greater truſt in the armour of godlynes, went into the Temple with two of his familiars, and lying proſtrate before the aulter or table, weping al the nighte, poured out praiers to God the Lorde of churches, that he would not ſuffer the woulfe to be mingled with the ſhepe, &amp; that he would not admit him, who entending to play the woulfes part, had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him ſelfe with a ſhepes ſkyn.

After he had thus prayed, he returned home weeping.</p>
                     <p>The next day following, Arrius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth forth with a great pompe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proud &amp; malapert, through the truſt which he had in the Euſebia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, by whom he thought, or rather dreamed, that he ſhould be placed forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in the biſhops throne. But marke a marueilous example of Gods

The train which came with him, to bring him to the temple with a pompe, looketh in the meane time when Arrius would come foorth, but he was thought to haue taried very long.

                     <p>This was the miſerable end of Arrius, whom although they which were of his iudgement and minde, laboured to deliuer from ſuche a foule ſhame (ſome ſaying that he was ſodenly taken about the hart) other ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng that ouermuch ioy &amp; mirth killed him, ſome affirming that he was poyſoned, yet many iudged, that Arrius through his impiety &amp; wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſuffered paine, ſent of God worthy his deſertes.</p>

Now this Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius whoſe arme was ſaid to be cut of, had ſomtime bene Athanaſius his reader, which Arſenius, fering leſt he ſhould be corrected for ſome fault, withdrew himſelfe from Athanaſius, and fled away. VVhoſe running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way (the wicked taking to be a iuſt occaſion of laieng the fore ſaid crime to Athanaſius charge) tooke Arſenius, and kept him cloſe in a certaine mans houſe, who was of the ſame conspiracie with them againſt Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius. And whither it were by the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation of his owne humanity, or by gods prouidence eſcaping, priuily in the night out of the priſon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued by ſhip vnto Tirus. And the day before Athanaſius ſhould be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigned, Arſenius came to his maiſter Athanaſius, &amp; opened all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto him, how his enemies we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about falſly to accuſe him of murther. Athanaſius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Arſenius to kepe him ſelfe cloſe within the houſe, that no man might know of his returne againe and preſence there. The councell did ſit, to the which al they which were of a malicious and ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minde againſt Athanaſius, did repaire. At y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyme one Paphnutius a confeſſor of God, was preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with Athaſius, who knew very well Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius innocencie and giltleſnes. VVhen he ſaw Maximus Biſhop of Hie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruſalem (who had his eye cut out, and his hamme cut of, as Paphnutius had for the confeſsing of gods truth) to ſit with other of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arrian factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, came before the middeſt of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, and ſaid: O Maximus, with whom I haue one &amp; the ſame badge of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confeſsion, with whom alſo one of my bodily eyes being put out, hath purchaſed a more cleare ſight of hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenly light, I will not ſuffer the to ſit in the councell of the wicked, &amp; to entre in with them that imagine miſchief. And ſo caſting his hande vnto him, did lift him vp, and tooke him from the middeſt of the councell. And geuing him inſtructions of the whole matter, coupled him euer after to the communion and felowſhip of Athanaſius.</p>
                     <p>But in the meane time the cauſe agaynſt Athanaſius went forward. Firſt of all they brought in a certaine woman (whome they had ſuborned to exhibite falſe accuſation and teſtimonie agaynſt him) who ſayd, that vpon a certaine night ſhe receyued Athanaſius into her houſe to lodging, and that ſhe ſuſpecting nothing leſſe, was violently corrupted and raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb facs="tcp:7195:117"/> of Athanaſius the ſame night. The iudges commaunded Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius to be brought forth, who commyng in, admoniſhed Timotheus his Chaplayn, that aſſone as the woman had tolde her tale, he ſhuld aunſwer and ſpeake vnto her, for he would holde his peace. Nowe when this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had finiſhed her Oration, as ſhe was taught, Timotheus turnyng vnto her, ſayd: VVas I euer receyued into thy houſe, O woman? and did I euer oppreſſe thee, as thou haſt ſayd? then ſhe (as the malapertnes of women is ſhameles, ſpeaking ſharply vnto him. Thou, thou (ſayth ſhe) eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt defiled my chaſtitie, and turning vnto the iudges made obteſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of her faith in God, that ſhe had ſpoken nothing but the truth. Then were they all aſhamed, and laughed at the matter, that the faction of this forged crime was ſo euidently and manifeſtly knowen.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the iudges could not be ſuffred to examine this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, where and by whom ſhe receyued the leſſon of this forged ſlaunder, for the accuſers did vſurpe to them ſelues the whole libertie of geuyng iudgement. VVell (this pageaunt beyng played) they obiected agaynſt him an other crime. They brought forth ſuch a wicked dede, as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer herde of before. They ſet before the iudges a coffin, vpon the whiche lay a dead mans arme. This is that, ſayd they, that cannot be coloured by crafty wordes, the matter is apparente, you may ſee it with your eyes, although wordes ceaſſe. This is the right arme of Arſenius, thy ſeruaunt, which how thou dideſt cut it of, or wherfore, now ſhewe and declare.</p>
                     <p>Then ſayd Athanaſius: whiche of you all here did knowe Arſenius, that you do knowe ſo well his right arme? Certayne aroſe vp, who were not of this faction and ſayde, that they knewe Arſenius very well. Then Athanaſius requeſted the iudges: that they would be ſo good, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund his ſeruaunt whom he had ſent out for certaine buſines, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and brought thither. And when Arſenius came in, Athanaſius lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp his head, ſayd to the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell and to the iudges: there is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius, this is euen he, and lifting vp his right hande, behold ſayd he, here is his right hande, and this is his left hande. Nowe inquire you, whoſe arm this is, which they haue broght here before you. Then a certain myſt and darckenes came before the eyes of the accuſers, not knowyng, what they might do, nor what waye to turne them. For ſure teſtimony was brought, that this was very Arſenius, who ſtoode there.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheles, bycauſe the councell was not kept for right iudgements ſake, but onely to oppreſſe an innocent man, forthwith, they al made a great ſhout and cryed, ſaying, that Athanaſius was a Magitian, and that he had deceyued their ſight, and therfore was a man not worthy to lyue any longer. And comming vpon him with great violence, would haue
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7195:117"/> torne and rente him with their handes. But Archelaus, who was preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the ſayd counſell, at the Emperours commaundement, tooke hym out of their handes, conueighed him into a priuie way, and bad him ſaue him ſelfe by flight, and depart from thence.

Ariſtotle was the diſciple of Plato, being a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wit, not only equal to Plato in eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but otherwiſe far exceding him: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had inſtituted the ſect of Peripatetikes, his maiſter being yet aliue, he gathered many ſchollers to be of his ſect.

He treated of all the partes of Philoſophie, and gaue preceptes to euery part. He was called Philoſophus the Philoſopher, by the figure <hi>Antonomaſia.

Therfore with what eyes wilt thou behold the temple of God; which is Lord ouer al, or with what feete wilt thou tread vpon the ſacred pauement? wilt thou hold forth theſe hands yet dropping with the bloud of an vniuſt ſlaughter, and with them wilt thou receyue
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7195:122"/> the body of the moſt holy god. Or wilt thou put that moſt precious bloude vnto thy mouth, whiche haſt ſhed ſo muche bloud in a ſhort ſpace in thy furious ſtomacke?

Then the emperor ſorowfully crying out, &amp; pouring forth teares more and more, ſayd: O Ruffinus, thou mockeſt me, for thou art not moued with the feeling of my harmes: but I doo ſigh and lament, whileſt I conſider my calamity, foraſmuch as the temple of God is open for ſeruants and beggers to go in freely, for to pray to god, wheras both it and alſo heauen is ſhut vp againſt me. For I do remember the words of the Lord which ſaith plainly, whomſoeuer thou ſhalt binde vpon earth, the ſame alſo ſhalbe bound in heauen. Than ſaid Ruffinus: I wil therfore runne to the biſhop, if it pleaſe you, and wil moue him by petition to looſe your bondes. He wil not be turned, ſaid the Emperour, for I knowe the iuſtice and equity of Ambroſe ſentence, neither wil he tranſgres the law of God, for the imperial power. But Ruffinus inſtantly vrging him, and with long talke, perſwading the Emperour, that he would pacifye Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, the Emperour biddeth him to go with expedition, and he himſelfe induced with hope, followeth a litle after, truſting to Ruffinus his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

And if he wil chaunge the Empire into a tyranny, I alſo wil ſuffer paines of death willingly.

But Ambroſe ſaid, that Theodoſius his comming was tirannous, and that he waxed wood againſt God, by viola<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting and breaking his lawes. The Emperour anſwered: I do not offer my ſelfe to ſtand againſt the ſanctions of lawes, nor to enter vniuſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the holy temple: but I pray thee releaſe me out of bonds, and that thou haue in minde the clemency of the Lord towards vs al, &amp; that thou wilt not ſhut vp againſt me the gate which the Lord hath opened to al thoſe that do repent. Then ſayd the biſhop, what repentance haſt thou ſhewed ſince y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thine ſo great wicked ſlaughter was don? or with what medicine haſt thou healed thy moſt greuous wounds? It ſhal be thine office (ſaid the Emperour) to temper the medicine, and to heale my very greuous wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and it ſhal be my part or duty, to vſe thoſe medicines, that thou ſhalt lay vnto them. Then ſaid Ambroſe: bicauſe thou committeſt thy iudgement to coler and anger, and not to reaſon, but a raging &amp; furious mind doth pronounce and geue ſentence: write thou a lawe, by the which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of thy iracundious minde may be made fruſtrate and vaine, and let ther be thirty daies preſcribed to geue ſentence of any murther, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of any goods, that thoſe daies might tary and expect the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reaſon. And when thoſe daies be paſt, let the writers of thy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence exhibite vnto thee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Then when thine anger is appeaſed, onely reaſon with iudgement ſhal be able to weigh, conſider and perceiue, whither that ſentence be iuſte or vniuſt. And if reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal proue it to be vniuſt, truly the writing ſhal be torne in peeces. But if it ſhal befound a iuſt ſentence, than it ſhall be eſtabliſhed, nor the number of the daies ſhal hinder or annoy the right ſentence. The Emperour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and allowing his order, commaunded forthwith a law to be writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten, which he confirmed with ſubſcription of his own hand. So at the laſt ſaint Ambroſe did abſolue him. And the Emperour than being bolde to enter into the church, not ſtanding, nor vpon his knees kneling, did pray vnto God, but lying flat and proſtrate vpon the ground, did vtter forth this voice of Dauid: <hi>Adglutinata eſt pauimento anima mea, viuifica me, ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cundum verbum tuum.</hi> My ſoule is glued and faſtened to the pauime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, reuiue me according to thy word.

It is called a collation, bicauſe the articles were compoſed, written, and made by the conference of the apoſtolical doctrine, that there ſhoulde be an Epitome of the whole chriſtian faith, both preached of the Apoſtles, and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the vniuerſal church.</p>

                     <p>Al theſe foure ſignifications of <hi>ſymbolum,</hi> do agree vnto the ſymbole of the Apoſtles, commonly called the Crede.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſaint Paule calleth the Corinthians, which had profeſſed the Goſpel, his epiſtle, not written forſoth, with yncke in parchment, but in their hartes with the ſpirite,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3</note> which ſpirite is called the finger of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondlye, the mynde that is once ſealed and marked to God, it is not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7195:125"/> lawfull to breake vp, or open to the Deuil. And the ſame Paule ſpeaketh in this wiſe to the Corinthians: we haue this treaſure in earthen veſſels. The minde therfore of man, through baptiſme,<note place="margin">2. Co. 4</note> is made the veſſell of the holy ghoſt, which veſſel is ſealed or marked with the ſignet of faith, yea more ouer Chriſt hath ſealed it with his own bloud. And in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Luk. 14</note> our Lord compareth the kingdome of heauen, that is to wyt, the grace of the Goſpell, vnto a feaſt royall, vnto which all men of al nations are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Now, whoſoeuer hath profeſſed Chriſt in baptiſme, he hath geuen a gage to come vnto this noble feaſt, ſo that it is not lawfull for hym nowe to ſtart backe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we do reade often times, that Chriſt is called by the name of a ſpouſe, as the church likewiſe is called by the name of a ſpouſeſſe,<note place="margin">Cant. 3 Ioh. 3</note> as in the miſticall Canticle, and in Iohn, yea moreouer, the ſoule of man in the profeſsion of the faith, is wedded vnto Chriſt her ſpouſe. Saint Paul declareth this writing vnto the Corinthians, ſaying:<note place="margin">2, Cor. 11</note> I haue married you vnto one huſband, that you ſhoulde ſhewe your ſelfe a chaſte virgine to Chriſt. Therfore a token is geuen of both parties, that it cannot be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for either other at any time to go about a diuorcement. Chriſt geueth the earneſt or pledge of his ſpirite. Man beleuing with his hart to his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and confeſsing or acknowledging w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his mouth, to his health and ſaluation: doth agayne of his part, geue a token or pledge to Chriſt.<note place="margin">Eph. 5</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Great is the miſtery (as ſaynt Paule ſayth) of thys marriage, whych is made and knytte wyth a faſt and a ſure vnlooſable bonde, betwene Chriſt and the Church.</p>
                     <p>Finally, and laſt of al, they which are newe borne againe by the holy bathe of baptiſme, they do profeſſe the euangelical chiualry or warre, &amp; do become ſeruauntes and ſoldiours vnder the immortall captaine Ieſu Chriſt, and are bound with his military ſacraments, and doo receiue the gift or reward of the ſprit. So that it is a point of extreme vnfaithfulnes, and alſo vnkindnes, to forſake this captaine, and runne from him to the tyraunt the Deuil. Now al they do forſake him, not onely which do deny Chriſt, and doo runne vnto the Turke or vnto the Iewes, but alſo which with their whole hart and minde are geuen to the worlde and worldlye commodities and pleaſures. For the righteous man alſo falleth euen ſeuen times a day. But he riſeth anone againe, by the quicknes and ſtrength of faith, which like fire doth alwaies labour vpward vnto heauenly things.</p>

                        <p>Thirdly, it is written in the prophet Eſay: <hi>Sanctus, ſanctus,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:7195:131"/> God graunted them libertie to eate of the beaſtes, and commaunded to kill them, and to ſhed their bloud.

Nor it was without iuſt and very great cauſes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God did forbid with ſo great ſeueritie the eating of bloud.

For the bloud ſhal clenſe the ſoule. And therfore I ſayd to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of Iſrael: let neuer a ſoule among you eate bloud. &amp;c. Lo, a very cleare and manifeſt reaſon is here rendred in theſe wordes, why it is not lawfull to eate bloud, ſeing that bloud is a moſt excellent thing, being appoynted for the ſanctification of men. For God gaue bloud to be as it were a price, whereby ſinnes might be clenſed, a reward, (I ſay,) for their redemption, by the whiche they might be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued from their ſinnes. Furthermore, bloud is life, that is, the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life. The bloud therfore ſignified, Chriſtes bloud to be ſhed vpon the Croſſe, by the which as a moſt full and perfect propitiation, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beleuers, are purged and ſanctified, and in the which is the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoule vnto euerlaſting life. And as it was not lawfull to eate of the fleſh of the Sacrifices, the bloud wherof was brought into the holy places, for ſinnes, but the Sacrifices were brent without the court: ſo like wiſe, it was vnlawfull to eate bloud, as though it were a purging for ſinne. He therfore did eate bloud, which attributed the perfect clenſing of ſinne by the bloud of Chriſt, to his owne ſtrength and workes, or els, thought Chriſts bloud to be prophane and vnholy, not aſcribing vnto the ſame a full ſanctification of all ſinnes. He did not eate bloud, but poured it out at the altar, who ſoeuer aſcribed the benefite of our redemption to the onely merite of Chriſt, and eſtemed it ſo much as it ought worthyly to be eſtemed. Moreouer God would haue this thing depely imprinted in the mindes of men, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſhed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bloud, or liue of the bloud and bowels of man, the whiche thing the hired and wicked ſoldiours do, couetous men, vſurars, &amp; deceyuers alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the ſame, ſhedding or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring the bloud of ſely wretched men, by crafty meanes and iniurious dealings with them.</p>

                  <p>And bycauſe the people, ouer who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was made gouernor, was a ſtiffnecked peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple and greatly corrupted in Egipt with the groſſe idolatrie of the land,<note place="margin">Egiptus. 28</note> he wrote not onely all the geſtes before ſayde, but alſo what ſoeuer the Lorde reuealed vnto hym, leaſt they might periſhe and be out of memory through the obliuion of a dull people, and by improbitie of tyme.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7195:133"/>
                  <p>But you muſt vnderſtande that although Moſes is ſayd to haue written the words of the Lord in the volume of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> law,<note place="margin">Tables of ſtone .29.</note> which God made vnto the people, yet he by his own ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did not write in the two tables of ſtone y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rules of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moral law called Decalogus, but toke them of God, not only miraculouſly made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work of God, but alſo written by the hand and power of God. So that Moſes (I ſay) did not write out of the mouth of God, but God him ſelfe wrate the worlds. For as God gaue the way and vſe of the Hebrue toung to ſpeake and talke with, ſo God him ſelfe firſt of all others, wrote the figures and formes of the letters. For Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had neuer written any thing whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſpake vnto him ſaying, come vp to me into the mount, &amp; I wil geue thee two tables of ſtone,<note place="margin">Exod <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

He was the firſt inuenter, actor and writer of the law conteyned in the two tables, and Moſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing them of God, deliuered them to the people.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding after that the holy Scriptures were written and deliuered vnto the people of god by Moſes, yet al reuelations, viſions, and apparitions, did not ceaſſe in Iſraell.</p>
                  <p>After the time of Moſes, Prophets were ſent, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo god gaue his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles &amp; anſwers by viſions &amp; reuelations. But the Prophetes did commit to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what ſoeuer they diſperſed and taught in Iſrael before by the worde, leaſt their poſteritie might haue had ſome excuſe of ignoraunce, but God preuented al ſuch cauſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (as it is written in <hi>Luke,) habent Moyſen &amp; Prophetas,</hi> they haue Moſes and the Prophetes. If they will not heare them, they wil not beleue if any riſe from the dead.</p>
                  <p>Nor the Scriptures of the olde teſtament onely were brought in after this ſort and order, but in like maner were the letters of the new Teſtament diſperſed and diſpoſed by the Euangeliſtes and the Apoſtles, as Ireneus in his firſt booke <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tra hereſes</hi> writeth. <hi>Quae primum (inquit) concionati ſunt Apoſtoli poſtea per volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tatem dei ſcripto nobis tradiderunt, eaque literis erant prodita quae ad ſalute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> noſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> videbantur neceſſaria.

VVhen he came to mans ſtate, and did ſe an Egiptian beating an Hebrue, he ſlue the Egiptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priuily, and hid him in the grauel or ſand, But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this came to Pharoes ears, Moſes left Egipt and went to the land of Madia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where he ſate a while by a well or a pits ſide, vnto the which well came vij. mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daughters of Iethro, to draw water to geue to their ſheepe, they were often moleſted of certeine

As he was on a tyme keeping his father in lawes ſhepe, he ſawe a buſhe burning, but not conſuming. At the whiche wondring he came nere to it,<note place="margin">Exod 3</note> and herd a voyce out of the buſhe ſaying, that he ſhould come no nigher, but that he ſhould put of his ſhowes, for the grounde in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he ſtoode was holy.

                        <p>Moſes was no Prieſt, this aſſertion I wil eſtabliſh out of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. VVhen God had commaunded Moſes, that he ſhoulde prepare all thinges that were mete and conuenient for the tabernacle of witnes, and for the ornature and decking of the ſame, then he commaunded him alſo, that he ſhould inſtitute and ordeyne thoſe whiche ſhould be Gods Prieſts (as it is written in the <hi>.28.</hi> of Exodus) but we read not in any of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7195:134"/> the fiue bokes of Moſes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer Moſes toke vpon him that office, nor euer put on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſts veſture. For if Moſes had bene a prieſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old law, there is no doubt, but that the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t would haue made ſome mention, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had bene conſecrate, but it recordeth no ſuch thing, Ergo it may euidently appeare, that Moſes was no Prieſt.</p>
                        <p>Againe, if he had bene a Prieſt, either he ſhould haue bene the highe prieſt, or a prieſt of the inferiour order.</p>
                        <p>If he had bene the high prieſt, he ſhould haue entred once onely in the yeare <hi>in ſancta ſanctorum,</hi> that is, into the holieſt place of al with bloud (as Paule ſaith in the <hi>.9.</hi> to the Hebrues.) But it is moſt certaine, that Moſes neuer entred into that place, <hi>Ergo</hi> he was not the high prieſt. If he had bene a prieſt of the inferiour order, he ſhould haue entred in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, morning and euening, into the holy place, to haue offered ſacrifice, but there is no man of ſo dul a minde, or groſſe wit, that dare ſaye Moſes to haue executed anye ſuche office, for why, the ſcripture doth deliuer no ſuch mention.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Paule calleth the Leuitical prieſthood, a prieſthood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Aaron, and not after the order of Moſes. Therefore, if Moſes had bene a Leuitical prieſt, Paul might haue ſayd, <hi>ſecundum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem Moſi,</hi> after the order of Moſes.</p>
                        <p>Ouer and beſide this, who doth not know, that Moſes, was a moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and wiſe law geuer, and did handle ciuil cauſes, and intreate in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and did heare &amp; diſcuſſe hard &amp; weighty matters?

                        <p>That is to ſay. VVhen therfore the high prieſthood ſeemeth to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne of Aaron, what do we thinke Moſes to haue bene? If he were no Prieſt, how were althings done by him? If he were, howe then do we define the chief prieſthood to haue begonne of his brother? although that Pſalme wher it is ſaid: <hi>Moſes &amp; Aaron in ſacerdotibus eius.</hi> Moſes and Aaron among his prieſts, doth take away al the doubt that Moſes was a prieſt: yet Aaron, and the ſucceſſors of that high prieſt, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to take the Prieſts garments, which doth containe a great ſacrament, or miſtery. In the booke of Exodus it is written, that before any thing was commaunded of the Prieſts to be ſanctified and ordred, when Moſes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vp into the mount, the prieſts were commaunded to aſcend, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we vnderſtand to be the ſonnes of Aaron, and no other, not bicauſe they were then prieſts, but bicauſe they were to be made after, the ſcripture doth ſo now call them by an anticipation. As there be many ſuch kinde of ſpeches and phraſes: For the ſonne of Naue, was called Ieſus, when the ſcripture doth ſhewe that his name was geuen to him long after, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both were prieſts, both Moſes and Aaron. Or was Moſes rather? &amp; Aaron vnder him? Or was Aaron the chiefeſt prieſt for the pontifical ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and Moſes for the more excellent miniſtery? For it was ſaid to him in the beginning: he ſhalbe thy ſpokes man vnto the people, &amp; thou ſhalt be to him as God.</p>

In fine his taking away was a pleaſaunt and merie departing out of the worlde: Yet notwithſtandyng he was not receyued into the celeſtiall glorye, but onely looſed from the miſeries of this preſent lyfe, vntill Chriſte ſhould come, beyng the firſt fruites of them that ryſe agayne.</p>
                     <p>And for aſmuche as he was one of the members of the Churche, it is neceſſarie, that he expecte and looke, vntill al come foorth to mete Chriſte, that the whole body may be vnited to the heade. If any man will obiect this ſaying of the Apoſtle (it is appointed for men once to dye,) the ſolution is eaſie, that death is not euer a ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, but they are coumpted to dye, whiche put of alſo the corruptible nature, as the death of them ſhalbe whiche ſhalbe found aliue at the laſt day, of whom Paul writeth to the Theſſalonians.</p>
                     <p>Chriſoſtome writyng vpon Geneſis, ſayth thus of Enoch. Marke here (I praye you) the vertue of a iuſte man, the great goodnes of God, and the diligence of the Scripture. Farthermore Enoch lyued <hi>.165.</hi> yeares and begatte Mathuſalem. And, Enoch walked with God, or Enoch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, after he had begotten Mathuſalem. Let all men and women har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto this, and let them learne the vertue of a iuſt man, neither let any man thincke, Mariage to be an occaſion, why he ſhoulde not pleaſe God. For the holy Scripture for this cauſe ſayth once or twiſe: he begat Mathuſalem, and then he pleaſed God. And it doth double and repete the ſame wordes agayne, ſaying: And he pleaſed God after he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: that no man might thincke, that Mariage is an obſtacle or let vnto vertue and godlines. For if we be ſobre, neither our education and brynging vp, neither matrimonie nor any other thyng, can hynder vs from the pleaſing of God.</p>
                     <p>For Enoch was of the ſame nature that we are of, neyther was there any lawe as yet written, neyther did the Scriptures teache hym thys, neyther was there any thyng elles whiche might enforce hym to imbrace wyſedome and honeſtye. It ſprange vnto hym at home, and it proceded of hys will that pleaſed God, that it ſufficeth hym vntill this daye, that he ſhoulde not vnto this tyme taſte of death.</p>
                     <p>For if that Mariage and the bryngynge vppe of chyldren were an impediment in the courſe of vertue, then God would not haue brought
<pb facs="tcp:7195:138"/> it into the life of man, to hurte vs with a thing temporall and moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie. But bycauſe it doth not onely not let vs to ſerue God (if we will lyue ſoberlie) but it bryngeth alſo a great conſolation vnto vs, while it kepeth downe the vnrulie force of our nature, nor doth ſuffer it to be troubled and toſſed lyke the ſea, but cauſeth the boate happely to arriue vnto the hauen, therfore God gaue Mariage as an ayde &amp; comfort vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Many of the olde writers do thincke, that Rome figura<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiuly, is ſignified by Babylon, bicauſe that as Babylon doth ſignifie confu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion, ſo Rome is called Babylon, bycauſe there was the ſincke and ſeat of all filthines, a confuſion of all impietie and idolatrie. The Papiſtes take occaſion of this gloſe, that Peter ſhould ſeeme to be Biſhop and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Romaine Churche, but of that I ſhall declare more at large hereafter. But yet marke the peruerſe nature of the Papiſtes, who paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not for the infamie and reproch of the name, ſo it may be lawful for them to haue a pretence, to eſtabliſh the title of the Romiſh ſee. Yea they do not greatly regarde Chriſt, ſo that Peter may be left vnto them, nay: I ſuppoſe, if they may retayne and maintaine the maner of Peters chaire, they will not refuſe to place it vnder the earth (I wil not ſay in hell.) But marke how they be contrary here one to an other. For ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> write, that Marke the Euangeliſte died at Alexandria, in the <hi>.8.</hi> yeare of the reigne of Nero, and that Peter was ſlayne at Rome ſixe yeares after, of the ſame Nero.

                     <p>If Origen take image to ſignify ſubſtaunce, he is in a manifeſt error, for if natural things did remainful and whole, as Dioniſius teſtifieth, in

                     <p>Victorinus, of whom ſaint Hierom learned Rhethoricke, in his diſpu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacion againſt Arrius, writeth thus: <hi>Aliud eſt iuxta imaginem quod qui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dem ſubſtantia eſt, aliud iuxta ſimilitudinem eſſe, quod non eſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, ſed in ſubſtantia nomen qualitatis declaratiuum. &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>It is one thing to be after the image which is a ſubſtaunce, and it is an other thing to be after the ſimilitude which is not a ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but a name of quality declared in the ſubſtaunce. And a litle after he ſaith: the ſoule therfore is perfect after the image now in this world, but after the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude it ſhalbe perfect afterward in God, and in Ieſus Chriſt it ſhall be ſuch as it ſhould haue bene if Adam had not offended. Therfore as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining to reſon, now it is perfect after the image: but as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to come, it is perfect after the ſimilitude. <hi>Hec Victorinus.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>VVe muſt beleue that Adam being man, to his woman one to one, man to man, huſbande to wife, not beleuing the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſpeaking the truth, to haue ben diſceiued in the tranſgreſsion of the law of God, but onely to haue geuen place to familiar felowſhip and frendſhip. For the Apoſtle ſaid not in vaine. Adam was not diſceiued: but the woman was diſceiued, ſauinge that ſhee tooke it to be true that the Serpente ſpake vnto her, and Adam would not be ſeparate from one felowſhip, no not in participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne. Yet therfore he was not the leſſe giltie, if knowing and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly he offended, wherof the Apoſtle doth not ſay, he did not ſinne, but he was not diſceiued. For he ſheweth plainly him to haue ſinned, where he ſaith: by one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, &amp; a litle after more playn-plainely he ſaithe: in the ſimilitude of the tranſgreſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Adam. And he would haue them to be vnderſtand diſceiued, which thinke not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing to be ſinne, whiche they do. But he knewe, or els how ſhoulde this be true, Adam was not diſceiued. But hauinge no experience of Goddes ſeueritie, might be diſceiued in this, that he beleued his faulte to be pardonable, and ſo by this he was not diſceiued in that thyng or point, in the which the woman was diſceiued.</p>
                        <p>Againe in his boke, <hi>De Geneſi ad literam</hi> expounding this matter more plainely, ſayth: <hi>Sicut Salomon vir ſummae ſapientiae in ſimulachrorum cultu no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> credidit aliquid eſſe vtilitatis, ſed mulierum amori ad hoc ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum trahenti reſiſtere non valuit, faciens quod ſciebat non eſſe faciendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ne ſuas quibus depirebat atque diffluebat mortiferas delitias, contriſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. Ita &amp; Adam. &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As Salomon a man of excellent wiſedome, did not beleue any profite to be in the worſhipping of idols, but was not able to reſiſte and withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the loue of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, drawing and alluring him to this miſchief, (doing that whiche he knew ought not to be done,) leaſt he ſhould make ſadde and heauy his deadly pleaſures, wherewith he doted and was drowned: Euen ſo Adam, after the woman being diſceiued, had eaten of the tree forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:148"/> and gaue to him that they ſhould eate together, he would not make her ſadde, whom he beleued might haue pined away without his comforte, if he ſhould haue ben contrarie to her mind, and ſo vtterly to haue periſhed in that diſcorde.</p>
                        <p>He was not ouercome with the concupiſcence of her fleſhe, whiche he yet felt not, nor the lawe of his members reſiſtyng the lawe of his minde: but was ouercome with a certayne frendly beneuolence and good will, by the whiche ſometyme it is brought to paſſe that God is offended, leaſt the man ſhould be made of a frend, an enemye. VVhiche thing that he ought not to haue done, the iuſt end of Gods ſentence doth declare and ſhewe, therefore he was not diſceiued after an other certayne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But I iudge and ſuppoſe, that he coulde be diſceiued no manner of wayes by the ſubtiltie of the Serpente, by the whiche the woman was diſceyued.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle doth call properly this to be a diſceyuing, by the whiche that thyng whiche was perſwaded, was thought to be true, when it was falſe: that is to ſaye, to thincke, that God did therefore forbidde to touche that tree, bycauſe he knewe them to be as Gods, if they had tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched it, as though he did enuie the diuinitie and Godhead vnto them, who had made them men. But if any deſire to haue experiment, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he ſaw the woman not to haue ben dead, after the fruite, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, did ſollicite the man through any pryde or arrogancie of mynde, whiche cannot be conceled from God the ſearcher of all ſecretes: yet I ſuppoſe him, if hee were then indewed with a ſpirituall minde, coulde by no meanes beleue, that God enuiyng them, did forbid them from the fruite of that tree, but that ſinne was perſwaded, as it might be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſuch. Hitherto Saint Auſten.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the pride of Adam, Saint Auſten in his booke <hi>De ciuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te dei,</hi> writeth after this maner. <hi>Non ad malum opus perueniretur niſi preceſsiſſet mala voluntas. Porro malae voluntatis initium quod po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit eſſe niſi ſuperbia. Initium enim omnis peccati ſuperbia eſt. &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There could not be a comming to an ill worke, except there had gone before an ill will. Furthermore what could be the beginning of an ill will, but pryde? for pride is the beginnynge of all ſinne. And what is pride, but the ambitious deſire of peruerſe loftyneſſe? For peruerſe loftyneſſe is in forſaking that beginning, to the whiche the minde ſhould cleaue and ſticke, to be as it were a beginning vnto him ſelfe, and this is done, when one doth ouermuch pleaſe him ſelfe, and ſo truly he doth pleaſe him ſelfe, when he doth ſwarue and departe from that immutable goodnes, which ought more to haue pleaſed him, then he him ſelfe. Agayne, in an other
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7195:148"/> place Auſten writeth: She ſaid, the Serpent diſceyued me, and I did eate. And he ſaid: the woman which thou gaueſt me, gaue me of the tree, and I did eate. But here ſoundeth in no place the petition of Pardon, the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for forgiuenes. For although theſe do not denie that which they com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted, as Cain did, yet notwithſtanding pride doth ſeke to referre and caſt it vpon other, whiche one hath done naughtily him ſelfe. The pride of the woman vpon the Serpent, the pride of the man vpon the woman: but it is an accuſation, rather then a true excuſe, where there is an open tranſgreſsion of Gods commaundement.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the idolatrie of Adam, the ſame Auſten likewiſe writeth at full <hi>In queſtionibus ex nouo Teſtamento.</hi> And thou mayſt perceiue, that he is not onely an Idolater whiche doth worſhip and adore an idoll in the ſtede of God, but alſo doth deſire equalitie with God by a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent arrogancie.</p>
                        <p>That Adam ſinned more greuouſly then Eue, after a certaine maner, many doctours and learned fathers do defend and define.</p>
                        <p>Saint Ambroſe <hi>De inſtitutione virginis,</hi> writeth after this ſort. <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier excuſationem habet in peccato, vir non habet.

Te enim mulier decepit, Illam ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lꝰ, licet malꝰ. Si tu inferiori non potuiſti reſiſtere, quomodo illa potuit ſuperori, culpa tua illam abſoluit.</hi> The woman hath excuſe in her ſinne, the man hath not: ſhe (as the Scripture affirmeth) was diſceiued of the Serpent the wiſeſt of all beaſts, thou of a woman, that is, the higher cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature diſceiued her, and the inferiour, thee: but an aungell (although ill) diſceiued her. If thou couldeſt not reſiſte the inferiour, how could ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte the ſuperiour? thy fault doth acquite her. Hitherto Saint Ambroſe. But yet thincke not here, that S. Ambroſe ment, that the fault of Adam doth vtterly take away the fault of Eue, as though ſhe ſinned not at all. But peraduenture he ment, that the offence of Adam did ſomwhat miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the fault of Eue.</p>
                        <p>The maiſter of the ſentence in his ſecond booke doth ſay, that Eue to ſpeak <hi>Simpliciter,</hi> did more offende, then Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bycauſe ſhe would vſurpe equalitie with the Godhead: and beinge pufte vp with to much preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beleued that it ſhould ſo come to paſſe. But Adam did not beleue it, but thought of repentaunce and of the mercie of God, when he geuing place to his wife, did conſente to her perſwaſion, not willing to make her ſadde, and to leaue her as one forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him, leſt ſhe ſhould pine through heauines, and ſo periſh.</p>
                        <p>Alſo Saint Ambroſe whiche ſemeth to perſwade that Adam offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more greuouſly then Eue, writeth in his boke <hi>De paradiſo: Adam no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <pb facs="tcp:7195:149"/> ſua culpa, ſed vxoris vitio lapſum eſſe.</hi> That Adam did not fal by his own offence, but by the fault of hys wife. Yet Ambroſe meaneth not by theſe wordes that Adam did not offende at all with his owne ſinne, for if he would, he nede not to haue geuen place to his wife.</p>
                        <p>But S. Auſten in his booke <hi>De ciuitate dei,</hi> doth exaggerate the fall of Adam, ſaying, that Eue tooke it to be true, that the Serpent ſpake to her, nor thought it to be ſinne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe did. But Adam did not beleue it to be true, whiche the pernicious enemie did ſubtilie ſuggeſt, &amp; he knew it to be ſinne that he did, and wittingly and willingly ſinned, and ſo after a certayne maner, offended more greuouſly then Eue, but yet not <hi>Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer,</hi> as the ſcholemen hold.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There be many contentious perſons which dare ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after the eating of the fruite of the tree, Adam had knowledge to diſcerne good and il, and not before. which thing were an extreme madnes.</p>
                        <p>For he that gaue names vnto al beaſts, &amp; which obteined y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> marueilous grace of Prophecie, whiche he pronounced of the woman, howe could he be ignorant what was good &amp; was what il? Again, if we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it, we ſhal
<pb facs="tcp:7195:150"/> bring blaſphemies againſt our creator, for how ſhould he geue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to an ignoraunt perſon, that tranſgreſsion was ill, but it is not ſo (God forbid) but Adam knew clearely, for that cauſe he made him in the beginning to be of a free will, whiche if it had not bene, neither ought he to be puniſhed when he had tranſgreſsed the commaundement, neither to haue bene rewarded if he had obſerued it, for he was made mortall through tranſgreſsion, as it appeareth by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, and thoſe things which folow, but before he was immortal. VVho therfore ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuffer or abide that man ſhould firſt receiue the knowledge of good and euill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the eating of the tree, which man before was full of ſo great wiſedom and obtayned with knowledge alſo Propheticall grace? And how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this be conſonant to reaſon, that he ſhould know the natures of goates, ſhepe and all other brute beaſts, and what herbe ſhould be holeſome and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for meate, and which vnholeſome, to ſeke one and auoide the other, and he him ſelfe being a reaſonable beaſt, not to know what is good and what is ill? But behold ſayth the Scripture, god calleth this tree, the tree of knowledge of good and euill. I am not ignoraunt of it, but if thou wilt learne the properties of the holy Scriptures, thou ſhalt know wherfore he geueth this name to this tree.</p>
                        <p>It was not ſo called bycauſe it gaue knowledge vnto man of ill, but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by it the tranſgreſsion of the commaundement was done, and ſo through that entred afterward knowledge of ill and ſhamefaſtnes, and therfore was it ſo called.</p>
                        <p>The ſcholemen and other later writers do ſay it was called the tree of knowledge of good and euill <hi>Ab eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tu,</hi> that is, of that which followed the eating therof, for although man did knowe before <hi>Speculatiue,</hi> what was il, yet he did not know it <hi>practice,</hi> by experience.</p>
                        <p>As for example, A Phiſition being in good health doth know diſeaſes onely be ſpeculation, but when he is ſicke, he doth better know them, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth both know them, and feele them.

                     <p>Caietanus reading this text after the verity of the Hebrue, doth ſay, that Moſes doth expreſſe here, not the perſon of the tyme in ſaying <hi>tunc,</hi> then, and not <hi>paſſiue, ſed actiue,</hi> (in ſaying to cal vpon) when man began not to cal vpon God (for that did Abel before in ſacrifiſing) but to call vpon God in that name <hi>Iehoua,</hi> which is a name of four letters. For Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doth ſhew the beginning of al religious actes among the Hebrues, to be in calling vppon this ſpeciall name of God, <hi>Iehoua,</hi> for the Hebrues do attribute marueilous vertues to the calling vpon this name. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore Moſes was very careful and diligent about the beginning of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation on ſuch a name. And by this texte wee maye learne, that the toung which is called the Hebrue toung, was before the floud. For this name <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> that is of foure letters, was of that ſame toung, and written with the ſame characters, but yet it followeth not, that this onely toung was before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> floud. For the ſcripture doth not ſo teſtifie, but
<pb facs="tcp:7195:153"/> doth onely ſay, that the children of Noe after the floud were of one ſpech and language.</p>
                     <p>The text of the Hebrues is this: <hi>Tunc ceptum eſt vt inuocaretur in nomine domini.</hi> Then began men to call vpon the name of the Lorde. In this text the Hebrue verbe <hi>Halal</hi> is of the third coniugation, and it is written in the beginning with <hi>He,</hi> and with a ſingle <hi>Lamed,</hi> but certain of the Hebrues, following an other ſignification of this verbe, which is to prophane or to make vnglorious, doo reade this: <hi>Tunc prophanatum eſt ad inuocandum nomen domini.</hi> That is: they did prophane and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the name of God vnto idols, bicauſe they began to commit idolatrie.

The true meaning of this text is this: Then began the hartes of the godly to be moued to reſtore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which a long time by the wicked had bene ſuppreſſed. And by this word <hi>inuocare,</hi> is ſignified the true woorſhipping of God to be reſtored, which through impiety was almoſt loſt.</p>
                     <p>Yet ther is no doubt, but that Adam and Eue, &amp; a few of their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wer the true worſhippers of God. And Moſes doth vnderſtand, that the flowing of impiety was ſo great in the world, that religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was almoſt come to vtter deſtruction, bicauſe it remained onely among a few perſons.</p>
                     <p>Now after Seth had begotten a ſonne like him ſelfe, and had his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly godly gouerned and ordered, then began ther to be a diſtinct face and ſhew of the church, &amp; the true worſhip of God was erected &amp; reſtored, which ſhould endure to the poſterity.

For the firſt, Lamech was the firſt man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ever had two wiues, contrary to the lawful inſtitution of mariage, which is that twoo ſhould be one fleſh. The Hebrues do ſay, that it was the manner before the floud to haue two wiues: the one for the cauſe of procreation of chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with whom the huſband ſhould haue no more to doo, after ſhe was with child, but being ſet apart, and apparelled with mourning clothes, dwelt alone as a widow. They ſay that of the two wiues of Lamech, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da ſerued for that purpoſe. The other wife they had to ſatiſfy their luſt and pleaſure. She was gorgeouſly apparelled and decked, and that ſhe ſhould not conceiue, nor be begot with child, and ſo to leeſe her beautye, drounke often the cup of ſterilitye, and with her huſband alwayes kept company. And they ſay that the other wife of Lamech, named Silla, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that tourne, who for the continual company of her huſband toke this name Silla, <hi>quaſi ſub vmbra illius ſedens,</hi> as ſitting vnder his ſhadow. For this Hebrue word <hi>Sil,</hi> doth ſignify <hi>vmbram,</hi> a ſhadow: but it maketh no matter, for what purpoſe and minde Lamech was entiſed to take to him ſelfe two wiues, when he did violate and defile the holy law of wedlocke, which was geuen and ſhewed forth of God. For God ordained, that ther ſhould be two in one fleſh, and this was the perpetuall order of nature. But this cruell man Lamech, with a beaſtly contempt of God, did cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the law of nature, and ſo the Lord would the corruption of lawfull mariage to come out of the houſe of Cain, and to begin with the perſon of Lamech, that Polygami, that is, they which haue two wiues at once, may be aſhamed by this example.</p>

                     <p>That <hi>Bigamia,</hi> that is to ſay, the hauing of twoo wiues at once, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the order of nature, it may be proued both by holy ſcriptures, and by learned fathers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is written in Geneſis: Therfore ſhal man leaue his father and his mother,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> and ſhal cleaue to his wife, and they two ſhalbe one fleſh. It is not here ſayde, he ſhall cleaue to his wiues, but to his wife. And Chriſt brought forth this moſt ſtraight law of wedlocke againſt the Phariſes, who vnwiſely and impudently did aſke of him, if it wer lawful for a man to forſake his wife for euery cauſe. And Chriſt to confute them, &amp; ſhake of their vaine queſtion by the holy ſcriptures, ſaid: haue you not red, that he which made them at the beginning, made them male and female, and ſaid:<note place="margin">Mat. 19</note> for this cauſe ſhall a man leaue father and mother, and cleaue vnto his wife, and they two ſhal be one fleſh, wherfore they are no more two, but one fleſh.

Saint Paule ſpeaketh alſo of the inſoluble knot and bande be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene man and wife,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6</note> and of the high miſtery ſignified therby.

Let one Eue be the mother of al perſons liuing, and let one church be the parent of al Chriſtians. As that curſed Lamech did deuide her in to two wiues: ſo heretickes rent &amp; teare this into many churches: which after the Apocalips of Iohn, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called the ſynagoges of the Deuill, then the counſell houſe of God.

                        <pb facs="tcp:7195:156"/>
                        <p>This whole text is ſomwhat obſcure and hard, and therfore the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues brought diuers and ſundry expoſitions of it.</p>
                        <p>The Iewes haue fained of this matter after their maner a fooliſhe and vaine tale. They ſay, that Lamech was an hunter &amp; blinde, and that he had a boy which led him by the hand, and that while Cain laye hidden in the buſhes, he was ſtricken through with an arow of Lamech: and that the boy thinking there to be a wilde beaſt, did direct Lamech his hand, and ſo tooke vengeaunce of the boy, which by his imprudencye was the cauſe of the murther.</p>
                        <p>They which receiued this tale, do affirme, that the wiues of Lamech did abſtain from his company, for the death of Cain. Lamech therfore to pacify his wiues, &amp; to ioyn them to him againe, doth ſhew vnto them hys murther, that it was not done of ſet purpoſe, but by chaunce, &amp; therfore no great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to be feared. For if pain &amp; vengeance was deferred for many yeares, vnto Cain that wicked and curſed murtherer, he thought that his pain ſhould be deferred vnto him for many moe yeres.</p>
                        <p>Other ſuppoſe, that the wiues of Lamech did auoid his companye, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſeuenth generation &amp; age was euen at hand, in the which they thought al the poſterity and iſſue of Cain ſhould be vtterly deſtroyd, for the death of his brother. VVhich thing when Lamech perceiued, he wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ioyne them againe vnto him, for the increaſe of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſo did endeuour to mitigate them, and did ſay, that he killed not a young man and a ſtripling, as Cain killed Abel, and therfore he ſaid: they neede not ſo greatly to feare, and if I ſhould ſuffer any miſchief or puniſhment, that the ſame ſhould be prolonged as yet for many yeares, for aſmuche as the pain of Cain, being the firſt murtherer, was deferred vnto the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Of this iudgement is <hi>Caldeus paraphraſtes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But omitting al theſe things, this following, ſemeth to be the very true ſence and meaning Lameches wiues, ſeing that al men hated him for his cruelty, wer afraid. Therfore he braggeth that ther is none ſo luſty, that wer able to reſiſt him, yea although he wer alredy wounded, and he moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at Gods ſufferance in Cain, ieſting as though God would ſuffer none to puniſh him, and yet gaue him licence to murther others. Therefore the intollerable violence of Lamech toward mankinde, did feare his wyues, leaſt al men making a conſpiracye, ſhoulde oppreſſe him, as he was moſt worthy euery mans hatred and curſe. Now that Moſes might expres his deſperate cruelty, when that the faire ſpeche of wiues is wont ſometymes to mitigate and appeaſe the fierſe and cruel huſband, he doth ſhew, that Lamech did vomit out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poyſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his cruelty, into the boſom of his wiues. The ſomme is this: he boaſted that he had both ſtomack and ſtrength y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to vanquiſh &amp; ouerthrow al that durſt aſſault him, and if ther
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7195:156"/> be any peril (ſaith he) I wil ſafely receiue it on my owne head, and at my peril, chaunce what chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may, I redely know away how to eſcape. And when he ſaw his wiues ſtricken with ſuch feare, he is not onely made not the meker, but doth ſharpen and edge him ſelfe forth vnto more cruelty. And ſuch is the beaſtly rage of cruel men, when they perceiue them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to be hated of al men, they are ſo farre from repentaunce, that they are ready to bury one murther with ten other.</p>
                        <p>Saynt Hierom writeth, that a Iew ſhewed him, that it was recorded in certain bookes apochryphal, that. <hi>77.</hi> ſoules came of the ſtock of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech, which were deſtroyed in the floud, and that in this number ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Lamech, whoſe kinred endured vnto the Catacliſme.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Hierome <hi>Contra louinianum,</hi> writeth: <hi>Primus Lamech ſanguinarius atque homicida vnam carnem in duas diuiſit vxores, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricidium et bigamiam catacliſmi paena deleuit, et de altero ſepties, &amp; de altero ſeptuageſies ſepties, vindicatum eſt: quantum diſtant in munero, tantum &amp; in crimine.</hi> That bloudy and murthering Lamech, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt that deuided one fleſh into two wiues, one paine of the floud did put away murther and bigamy. Of the one vengeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was taken ſeuen times, of the other ſeuenty times ſeuen: how much theſe differ in number, ſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer they in fault.</p>
                        <p>Saint Auſten <hi>In queſtionibus veteris teſtamenti,</hi> ſayth: <hi>Sed fruſtra hoc putant, qui arbitrantur quod Lamech hoc dixerit de Cain, occidi vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rum in liuorem mihi, &amp; iuuinem in vulnere meo. Iam enim in quinta generatione natus erat Lamech a Cain, id eſt, de Mathuſalem ab nepote Cain. &amp;c.</hi> But they doo vainelye ſuppoſe this, that Lamech ſpake this of Cain: I have ſlain a man in my wound, and a young man in my hurt. For Lamech was borne in the fift generation of Cain, that is, of Mathuſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which was of the fourth degree in linial diſſent. But Lamech doth ſpeake this, that he would ſhew him ſelfe to be more ſharplye puniſhed, which offended vnder a manifeſt law: and by this, if vengeaunce was taken ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times after Cain vpon his follower, how much more vengeaunce is to be taken vpon him, whom neither the fact nor correction of Cain, neyther the ſentence geuen againſt him did feare, that it ſhould turne his will fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo wicked and miſcheuous a deede?</p>
                        <p>After Cain therfore Lamech committed murther, whiche withoute doubt ſuffered ſeuen reuengements: and what ſhould chaunce vnto him, that doth follow the ſame after Lamech, he ſheweth, ſaying: Of Lamech vengeaunce ſhal be taken ſeuenty times ſeuen tymes, that for bicauſe re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pentaunce didde not follow the yll woorke, hee ſhoulde be ſmitten with the ſtrokes of ſeuentye ſeuen plages, therefore when Lamech dothe confeſſe him ſelfe to haue killed a younge man, and Cain could not liue to that time, or if he didde (which ſeemeth impoſsible) he was olde, and
<pb facs="tcp:7195:157"/> not yong, and therfore Lamech, killed him not. This wuch ſaynt Auſtine.</p>
                        <p>Yet ſome out of ſaint Anſtens writings do reaſon and argue, that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech killed Cain: for he graunteth, that Lamech paid the ſeuen fold ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce, but in following the hiſtory of Geneſis, he ſhould not haue payd or loſed the ſeuen fold vengeaunce, except he had killed Cain, Ergo it may be concluded, that Lamech killed Cain, although the text doth not openly declare it.</p>
                        <p>Saint Hierome, ſpeaking of the ſeuen fold reuengement of Cain, doth ſay, that it is not ment that he which ſhould kill Cain, ſhould be ſubiect to ſeuen vengeaunces: but that he that killed him ſhould looſe the ſeuen vengeaunces, which were ſo long time together in Cain, who being aliue was left wholy and all vnto payne.</p>
                        <p>Ephrem writeth, that Lamech co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted two murthers. <hi>Aliud enim (inquit) eſt vir, aliud adoleſcens.</hi> For (ſaith he) a man is one thing, and a young man, an other: Yet Theodoretus writeth, that Lamech killed not 2 but one man, of a floriſhing &amp; luſty age, &amp; not Cain, as many doo fable.</p>
                        <p>Yet ſaint Hierom holdeth the contrary, that Lamech killed Cain. For he writeth in his firſt queſtion <hi>Ad Damaſum papam: Maiorum noſtroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iſta ſententia eſt, quod putant in ſeptima generatione a Lamech interfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſſe Cain. &amp;c.</hi> This is the mind of our forefathers, that Cain was kil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led of Lamec, hin the ſeuenth generation. For Adam begat Cain, Cain be gat Enoch, Enoch begat Iarad, Iarad, Mahinael, Mahinael, Mathuſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Mathuſalem Lamech, which was the ſeuenth from Adam.</p>
                        <p>But Chryſoſtom expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place of Geneſis, doth not graunt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech killed Cain, although he graunt, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted two murthers.</p>
                        <p>Lyranus vpon that place writeth after this manner: bicauſe Lamech brought in bigamie, he was puniſhed by his wiues, for by what thinges a man doth offend, by thoſe thinges he is tormented. And therefore being made an old man, was il intreated by his wiues. And willing to repreſſe them from the euyls which they did vnto him, he ſayd vnto them: bicauſe I haue killed a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in my wound. To the vnderſtanding wherof, we muſt know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lamech waxing blind, had a guide to leade him, &amp; ſo we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fields to hunt, not for fleſh (for that time they did eate none) but for the ſkins, which they did weare. And Cain lay hid among the buſhes, bicauſe he was alwaies in feare: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the yong man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> led Lamech, ſeing (bicauſe he was of a quicker ſight then Lamech) ſuppoſed it to be ſom beaſt, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ſaid vnto Lamech, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould direct his arow thither, which being don, when he perceiued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had killed Cain, whoſe killing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid vnder greuous paines, he beat the yong ſtripling ſo ſore, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he killed him, and by this is ment, that he ſaid, I haue killed a man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is Cain, in my wound, that is by a wound geuen of me: and I haue killed a yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7195:157"/> did guide &amp; direct me. And this is the common opinion, ſaith Lyra.</p>
                        <p>Other do otherwiſe expound this ſentence: I haue killed a man in my wound (as if Lamech ſhould ſay) I haue killed a man, and a young man, <hi>in liuore meo,</hi> in my hart, that is, of enuy, as Cain did, which killed Abel, as though he ſhould ſay, no.</p>
                        <p>The Hebrues do ſay, that this young ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom he killed, was his own ſonne called Tubalcain, who was the firſt inuenter of the craft in woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of braſſe and yron.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two wordes <hi>vulnus</hi> and <hi>liuor,</hi> after the cenſure of ſome, may be diuerſly red, either in the accuſatiue caſe, or in the ablatiue caſe. If in the accuſatiue caſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſence is this: if ther be any peril, let it light on my bed, &amp; whatſoeuer chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, let me ſmart for it, for I know how to eſcape.</p>
                        <p>But if it be red in the ablatiue caſe, then it maye haue a double ſenſe. The firſt is this: although I were wounded, yet am I able to kill a man. VVhat wyll I then do, if I be luſty and whole? The other ſenſe is this, which ſemeth more ſound and more agreable. If anye man prouoke me with iniury, or atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt to bring any viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to me, he ſhal wel fele &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue, that he hath to do with a ſtrong and valiaunt man: for if he once hurt me, he ſhal not eſcape ſcotfree.</p>
                        <p>Ther is a great controuerſie among the writers, whether Lamech re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pented and confeſſed his fault, or no.</p>
                        <p>Chriſoſtomus, Rupertus, and Alcuinus holde the affirmatiue part, but other of great learning and depe iudgemente, doo holde the negatiue part, &amp; do write that he reioiced &amp; bragged of his cruelty &amp; murther.</p>
                        <p>VVhat is to be auenged ſeuen fold, and ſeuenty times ſeuen folde, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue diuers iudgements.</p>
                        <p>Saint Hierome ſaith, that vengeaunce was taken ſeuen folde of Cain, bicauſe he was ſlain in the ſeuenth generation, that is, in the time of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech, &amp; did ſuffer pain for his fault, the ſpace of ſo many generacions. He liued vpon the earth mourning and trembling, &amp; that the reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeuenty times ſeuen fold in Lamech, was the ſeuenty &amp; ſeuen ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerations fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Adam vnto Chriſt. Reade Luke the Euangeliſt (ſaith he) &amp; thou ſhalt find it to be ſo, as we ſay.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3</note>Concerning the firſt, it is written in Geneſis, that Noe began to be an huſband man, and planted a vineyard, and he dronke of the wine, and was dronken, &amp; was vncouered in the midſt of his tent. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cham the father of Canaan, ſaw the nakednes of his father, he told his two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without.

                     <p>Chryſoſtom diſcourſing this piece of ſcripture, doth thinke that Noe is not to be accuſed, but excuſed, and that by thre reaſons.

                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is this: he fel into this dronke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes through ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which properly is called <hi>ignorantia inuincibilis,</hi> bicauſe he could knowe &amp; learn of none the power &amp; ſtrength of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine, &amp; therfore he fel into ebriety ignorantly, and not willingly through a corrupt wyll:</p>

Chryſoſtom expounding that alſo which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined in the ſame ſtory (that is, that Noe awoke from his wine, &amp; knew what his younger ſon had done vnto him, &amp; ſaid: curſed be Canaan, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uant of ſeruants ſhal he be vnto his brethren) ſpeaketh after this maner: <hi>Et haec dico, non vt iuſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> incuſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, multa enim erant propter quae illi venia debebatur. &amp;c.</hi> &amp; I ſpeak theſe things, not to accuſe the iuſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for ther wer many things, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was due vnto him, eſpecially bicauſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7195:158"/> he ſlid not again afterward into the ſame fault: which is a great argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he fel before by ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; not by negligence, for if it had ben by negligence, he ſhould haue ben enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled agayn w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame fault, whiche happened not. For if that ſhould haue happened agayn, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would not haue concealed it, but haue vttered it vnto vs. For this is one ſcope and end of the Scripture, for it doth not intermit any notable or notorious fact, but doth teach vs the truth: neither through enuie doth paſſe ouer the vertues of the the righteous, neither for the fauour of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked doth ſhadow and kepe cloſe their ſinnes, but doth propoſe and ſhewe forth all things ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly and plainly vnto vs: that we might haue therby mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents and certain doctrines, and that when we fall through neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into any ſinne, we may be made after, more ware, leaſt we fall into the ſame agayn. For it is not ſo greuous a thing to ſinne, as it is to perſeuer in ſinne. Therfore, do not onely attend and marke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the righteous Noe was dronke, but note alſo the ſame thing did neuer chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to him again after.</p>
                     <p>Now conſider thoſe whiche do dayly conſume their tyme in wyne ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes, and (as I may ſay) do almoſt dayly die in them. Yet if they come to good aduiſement agayn, they do not refraine them ſelues from the ſame daunger, but do returne to it agayne, as to their dayly worcke, whiche Noe did not.</p>
                     <p>Ouer and beſide, the name of ebrietie in the holy Scripture is not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of dronckennes, but doth ſignifie ſacietie. Therfore a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perchaunce may ſay this, of this righteous man: not that he was droncken through intemperancie, but the ſame chaunced to him through ſacietie. As Dauid ſpeaketh: <hi>Inebriabuntur ab vbertate domus tuae,</hi> they ſhalbe made droncke with the plentifulnes of thy houſe, that is, they ſhalbe made full.</p>
                     <p>Therbe many things that declare that righteous man Noe worthy of pardon, which I do not ſpeake as though I would excuſe his ebrietie: but do ſhew, that he was ſupplanted, not by inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perancie, but by ignoraunce, and that his ebrietie perchaunce to be accuſed, to haue rather flowne and come of ſacietie, then of inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perancie. And here thou ſeeſt, that this word <hi>Ebrietas,</hi> is <hi>Homonimon,</hi> or equiuocall, ſignifieng diuerſe things. In the ſeconde of Iohns Goſpell it is taken likewiſe, not for verye dronckennes,<note place="margin">Iohn 2.</note> but for fulnes: as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gouernour of the feaſt ſayd vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bridegrome: all men at the beginning ſet forth good wine, and when men be dronke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then that which is worſe. S. Ambroſe in his booke <hi>De Noe &amp; arca,</hi> doth ſeme plainly to excuſe the dronckennes of Noe. <hi>Sobria (inquit) erat mens iuſti, quando ebria putabatur: eſt enim praeclarum poculum, inebrians iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtis, &amp;c.</hi> Then was the mind of the iuſt man ſober, when it was thought dronken. For it is a noble &amp; worthy cup which doth make dronken the
<pb facs="tcp:7195:159"/> righteous: but he was truly droncken, which laughed at his father: for he that had no conſideration of the grace and fauour of the generation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſt, neither of preſent reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce towarde his father, nor of the paine to come of contumely done to his father, was very droncke: &amp; that which he thought to ſee, he ſawe not: for there was in hym a profound, and depe blindnes, which culd not ſe his father for if he had ſene his father, he wold not haue laughed, for the father is not to be laughed at, but to be reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And how did he ſee, whiche thought errour of doubtfulnes to be in hym, in whom is the perfect vapour and moiſtnes of wiſedome and other vertues? And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the mynd more ſober, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it doth ſo behold &amp; vewe the nature of all thinges, of times preſent, and tymes to come, that there appeared in him no temporall ſtaggering of dronckennes?</p>
                     <p>Againe in his booke <hi>De Abraba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Patriarcha,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Multi ſe fortes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. Num fortiores qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Loth? Num continentiores quam Noe?</hi> Many thinke themſelues to be ſtrong: but ar they ſtronger then Loth? are they more continent then Noe: the Scripture doth not ſpread forth the faults of the Patriarches, whom we read to be ouercome with wine, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhouldeſt learne wherof to beware. He lay naked: this man was open to the errours of his daughters. Noe the iuſt was diſceyued, bycauſe he was as yet ignoraunt. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thomas the ſcholeman in <hi>.2.2.</hi> where he doth excuſe the ebriety of Noe, ſaith in his firſt article. <hi>Ebrietas dupliciter poteſt accipi: vno modo vt ſignificet defectum hominis, qui accidit ex multo vino potato, ex quo fit, vt non ſir compos rationis. &amp;c.</hi> Ebrietie may be taken two maner of wayes. In the firſte maner it doth ſignifie the infirmitie of man, whiche commeth of drincking of much wine, wherby he is made <hi>No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> compos ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> not hauing ful poſſeſsion of reaſon. And this maner of ebriety doth not nominate and ſignifie the fault, but the penall defect, flowing out of the fault. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d maner of ebrietie doth nominate the acte, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which ſome ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth fall into the ſame defect which may cauſe droncke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes two maner of wayes. Firſt by the great ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine, whiche he knoweth not that doth drincke it, and this ebriety may happen without ſinne, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it chaunceth not by the negligence of man, and ſo Noe was was thought to haue bene droncken.</p>
                     <p>Secondly it doth come of inordinate concupiſcence and luſt, and of an vnmeaſurable vſe of wine: and ſo is ebrietie mortall ſinne, and is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder the ſinne of glotonie. <hi>Sicut ſpecies ſub genere,</hi> for glotony is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into ſurfetting and dronckennes, which Paule writing to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains doth forbid, ſaying: <hi>Sic vt in die honeſte ambulemus, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in comeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſationibus &amp; ebrietatibus.</hi> Let vs walke honeſtlie as in the day, not in glotonie and dronckennes. To be ſhort, he ſayth, that ebrietie is mortall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7195:159"/> ſinne. As when man drincking wine, doth not thincke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath ſo quicke and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a ſtrength, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it will quickly ſmite and hurt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> braine, &amp; he yet notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding doth largely &amp; exceſsiuely vſe it, doth mortally ſinne.</p>
                     <p>S.

                        <p>VVhither Noe did il, in curſing Canaan? The whiche queſtion Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome diſcourſing, writeth after this ſort. <hi>Ecce prouenimus ad queſtio nem illam vbique celebrem, multos enim audimus dicentes, quare cum peccauerit pater &amp; prodiderit nuditatem, filius maledictu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuſcepit. &amp;c.</hi> Behold we are now come to that famous queſtion. For we here many ſay: why doth the ſonne receiue the curſe, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father offended &amp; ſhewed his nakednes? I beſech you geue diligent attendau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and take the ſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for we will ſpeake thoſe things which the grace of God wil miniſter vnto vs for your profit. Noe ſaid: curſed be Canaan, and he ſhalbe the ſeruaunt of his brethren. He made not here mention of his ſonne <hi>Simpliciter,</hi> and that for ſome ſecrete and hidden reaſon, for he would chaſten his ſonne for his ſinne and contumelie, which he did vnto him: but yet he would not be preiudiciall vnto the bleſsing, whiche was geuen him before. For the Scripture ſaith: God bleſsed Noe, when he came out of the arke, and his
<pb facs="tcp:7195:160"/> ſonnes. Therfore that he might not ſeme to haue curſed him, whom God had bleſsed, paſsyng ouer him whiche had done this reproche vnto him, brought the curſe vnto his ſonne. Noe (ſayth he) doth ſhewe this that therfore Cham is not curſed becauſe he tooke benediction before of God: but wherfore doth he ſuffer pain, when an other hath offended? neither this alſo is done without reaſon, becauſe the father had no leſſe paine and torment then the ſonne. For you know that the fathers often do pray that they themſelues might ſuſtaine the paines of their children, and in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is more greuous vnto them to ſe their poore childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tormented, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they ſhould be ſubiect to the ſame them ſelues. Therfore this ſame was done, becauſe he for the nature and loue toward his ſonne, did feele grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſorowe, and that the bleſsing of God ſhould be kept inuiolate, and lykewiſe the childe takyng curſe, ſhoulde ſuffer paynes for hys owne ſinnes. For although through the fathers ſinne he is nowe ſubiecte vnto curſe, yet it is lykely, that he ſuffred paynes for his owne ſinnes alſo. For he toke not onely the curſe of the ſin due to the father, but that he ſhould ſuffer alſo greater payne for him ſelfe. For neither the fathers for the children, nor the children for the fathers, ſhalbe puniſhed, but euery man ſhall ſuffer for his owne ſinnes. This we finde written in all places of the Prophetes,<note place="margin">Eze. 18</note> the ſoule whiche ſinneth ſhe ſhall die, and againe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall not dye for the children, nor the children for the fathers. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This therfore that Chriſoſtome ſaid, that Canaan, the ſonne of Cham ſuffred payne, not onely for the ſinne of his father, but alſo for his owne ſinnes: doth diſsolue the argument whiche might be moued and toſsed out of theſe Scriptures, that is, the ſon ſhal not beare the iniquitie of the father, nor the ſonne ſhall dye for the father. VVhiche Scriptures are chiefly to be vnderſtande of eternall payne, and to be vnderſtande alſo when the ſonne hath by no meanes offended nor conſented to the ſinne of his father.</p>
                        <p>Saint Ambroſe in his booke <hi>De Noe &amp; arca,</hi> doth conſent with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, ſaying. <hi>Qua ratione Noc cum filius eius Cham peccauerit, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ipſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſed filium eius ſeruituti addixit?</hi> By what reaſon did Noe when his ſonne Cham had offended, appointe not him, but his ſonne vnto bondage and curſe?</p>

                        <p>Saint Auſten alſo rendreth an other anſwere, in his booke <hi>De ciuitate dei,</hi> where he writeth, that by Cham being the middle ſonne of Noe, be ſignified heretikes: which remayne not in the firſt fruites of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelites, but remaine betwene both.</p>
                        <p>Lyranus diſſouing this, queſtion doth ſay. <hi>Hic nominatur Canaan, quia ſecu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dum aliquos is primum vidit coopertium, Noe, &amp; patri ſuo Cham iudicauit. &amp;c.</hi> Here is Canaan named, becauſe after ſome he ſawe firſt Noe vncouered, and ſhewed it to his father Cham: After other becauſe it is entreated here, of the wickednes of Cham, which behaued him ſelf vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerently towardes his father.

VVhat ſhall we thincke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, will come and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to idle bellies and vnſaciable goulfes of drincking, which onely ſhote at this marke, in ſtriuing how much wine they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſume and quaffe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and haue in no caſe reſpect to that curſe of God, which is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced agaynſt them,<note place="margin">Eſa. 5.</note> whiche ryſe early in the mornyng to drincke, and ſo to continew vntill might.</p>
                        <p>Truly God would by this enſample of Noe, admoniſhe mankind to beware of dronckennes, and not to make any pretence of excuſe, becauſe the holy man Noe was once ſubiect vnto dronckennes.</p>
                        <p>It is permitted for vs to drincke wine, nor it is ſinne to drincke it, which the deuils doctrine doth forbid. But in theſe dayes vnto the Papiſtes, ebrietie is no ſinne: but to eate fleſhe on certaine dayes forbidden by the Pope, yea in the time of nede, they counte it a ſinne vnpardonable.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the curſing of Canaan, although Noe had a iuſt cauſe to be angrie, yet he ſemeth to behaue him ſelfe neither modeſtly nor graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: he ſhould at the leaſt ſecretly haue lamented his fault before God, and haue teſtified his repentaunce with ſome ſhame before men. But now as though he had nothing offended, doth thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre out a ſharper curſe againſt his ſonne. But Moſes doth not report here the checkes and tauntes, into the which Noe being ſtirred with coler and anger, doth burſt out, but doth bring him in rather ſpeaking with the Propheticall ſpirite. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no doubt, but that the holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being humbled with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his fault, did weigh with him ſelf what he had deſerued, and alſo did pronounce with a very bitter ſorrow of minde this ſentence agaynſte hys ſonne, for he conſidered howe merueilouſly he was preſerued among a fewe.</p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:7195:161"/>
                        <p>Now therfore when he was conſtrained by his own mouth to expell hym out of the Church of God, there is no doubt, but that he greuouſly mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and lamented for the curſe of his ſonne. But in this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, God doth geue vs a godly doctrine, that we muſt retaine and kepe the conſtancie of faith, if we ſee at any tyme them to faile, whiche be nere ioyned vnto vs, yea, and that we ought not to ſhrinke nor relent, by no meanes: but ſo to exerciſe the ſeueritie which God commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, that we ſhould not ſpare our owne bowels. And note alſo, that Noe did not pronounce this harde ſentence, but by the inſtinct of God. Here may we gather of the cruelnes of paine, how horrible before God is the wicked contempt of parentes.</p>

                        <p>Here may be demaunded, why Noe did not curſe Cham the ſonne of him ſelfe, rather then Canaan the ſonne of Cham: for the fault is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto Canaan, but vnto Cham: and it is not agreable to the iuſtice of God, to throw the parentes faultes vpon the children.</p>

                        <p>But it is meruell, that Noe curſing his nephew, ſpake nothing of his ſon Cham, being the author of the ſame, but ther is no doubt (that the gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uouſnes of the payne may more appear) the payn is to be transferred and brought to the poſteritie.

                        <p>There is yet an other doubt to be moued. For when the Scripture doth teach, that God doth reuenge the ſinnes of men into the third and fourth generation, it ſemeth here, to prefixe &amp; appoint a meane vnto the wrath of God: for the vengeaunce, whiche is here mentioned, doth ſpread her ſelfe vnto the tenth generation.</p>

                        <p>In the wordes of the Scripture there is no law preſcribed vnto God, whiche it is not lawfull for him to go beyond, as though he ſhould not be fre in puniſhing of ſinnes to go beyond the fourth generation. Here ye muſt ſee onely the compariſon betwene payne and grace, by the whiche God doth ſhew him ſelfe ſuch a iuſt reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of ſinnes, that he is yet more prone and ready to ſhewe mercy, then iuſtice.</p>
                        <p>Two thinges in this are to be noted: Firſt, that the originall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſeruitude and bondage, began of Canaan, which came through ſinne. The ſecond thing to be obſerued is, how greuouſly God did plage and puniſh them, whiche do not with due honour proſecute and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their parentes, whiche may be a godly leſson to be learned of peruerſe and diſobedient children.

                        <p>Secondly, bycauſe he receyued the bleſsing of Melchiſedech, for laye men do receiue benediction of Prieſtes.</p>

                        <p>It is to be aunſwered, there is no abſurditie to graunt Abraham in the law of nature to be both Prieſt and lay man. In taking a Prieſt in the large ſignification, that is, for him whiche doth geue, and offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices vnto God with a ſincere affection and pure minde, whiche alſo they did proteſte with offring of outward Sacrifices. VVas not Abel a Prieſt, and yet alſo a ſhepheard?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, where it is to be obiected that he was no Prieſt becauſe he payed tith, and receyued bleſsing, it foloweth not, for the Leuites gaue tenth of tenth vnto the high Prieſt, as it appeareth in the booke of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meri: but that reaſon doth onely proue, that he was not the high Prieſt, but inferiour vnto Melchiſedech, of whom as of the chief Prieſt, the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Prieſt receyued benediction.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly alſo Abraham, although he were not the firſt borne by nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, yet he was chief by dignitie, and therfore Prieſtly dignitie did not vnaptly agree vnto him. Abel was not the eldeſt by birth, but he was the firſt by excellencie and dignitie, and yet was he enobled with prieſthode.</p>
                        <p>Thus much touchyng Abraham, who at the firſt (as Rabanus teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth and other) was an Idolatre. His wordes be theſe: <hi>Adueniente A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham in terram Canaan, quam tunc Cananeus habitator tenebat, ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruiſſe ei dominus deſcribitur, cui altare ipſe edificauit, quia ſpretis ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis gentium, vnius dei cultor fuit.</hi> Abraham commyng into the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, which then the Cananites did inhabite, the Lord appeared vnto him, vnto whom Abraham builded an altar: becauſe forſaking &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning the Idols of the gentiles, he became the worſhipper of the true God He died (as ſome recorde) <hi>.35.</hi> yeares before Sem died.

VVher we may learne, that no man is to be blamed and accuſed for eating any kinde of meate, but for the immoderat deſire and greedy luſt therof. Iſaac was old, and through age his ſight failed hym. He wuld haue bleſſed his elder ſon, &amp; in ſtede of him (not knowing) bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed the younger ſonne: who couering his hands and his necke with goates ſkins, offred him ſelf to his fathers hands, in the roume of his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was al heary. This diſceit of Iacob, that it ſhuld not be thought any crafty diſceit, but rather the miſtery of ſome great thing ſhoulde be ſought therin, the ſcripture hath declared before, ſaying: Eſau was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cunning in hunting. Iacob was a plain man abiding at home. This thing ſome of our men haue interpreted to haue bene done without diſceit: whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther it be without diſceit, ſimply or plainly, or rather done without fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which is in Greke <hi>Aplaſtos,</hi> what is the diſceit of a man without diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceit in receiuing this bleſsing? And how can ther be diſceit in a ſimple or plain man? And what other faining can ther be of him, which doth not lie, but ſome profound miſtery of truth? And a litle after he ſaith: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bleſsing of acob is the preaching of Chriſt among all Gentiles. The law and the prophets wer in Iſaac .&amp;c. reade the place, &amp; ther ſhal you finde, that Iacob did not offende, when he bought the birth right of Eſau: and that he did not lie, when he ſaid to his father, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne Eſau.

Chriſoſtome doth not diſsent from ſaint Auſten, who writeth vpon that place thus: <hi>Ne igitur hoc conſidera, quod mentita fuerunt quae dicebantura Iacob, ſed illud co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gita, quod volens deus praedictionem impleri, omnia vt ſic fiant, diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauit. &amp;c.</hi> Do not thou therfore conſider, that the words ſpoken of Iacob, were lies, but think rather this, that God willing the prophecy to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, did diſpence, that al thinges ſhould be ſo done.</p>

VVhen Iſaac therfore the father of Iacob and Eſau, was very rich, it is very likely, that the birthright was much worth, and of great value. And ſo Iacob obtaining the birthright for a trifle, diſceiued his brother, and craftely got great gaines by hym.</p>

Therfore, foraſmuche as the intereſt of this birthright was due by Gods ordinaunce vnto Iacob, he did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Eſau, nor committed any fraud in byeng or rather recouering the birthright of him. And he is not compted properly to haue bought them, for by Gods ordinaunce they pertained vnto him, and no man doth bye that which is his own. Therfore the ſenſe of this propoſition (ſell me thy birthright) is this: Geue me thoſe things pertaining to thy birthright, which are myne, and bicauſe thou wilt not geue them freely, here I offer thee meate.</p>
                        <p>Rabbi Salomon to excuſe Iacob from lying, doth ſaye, that the texte muſt be thus poynted: <hi>Ego ſum,</hi> I am he which bring meate vnto thee, but Eſau is the firſt begotten ſonne. But this pointing doth corrupt the ſenſe. For if one diſceiue another by any craft of words, he cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from lying. But the ſincere &amp; true explication of the ſtory is this: Although Iacob were not Eſau in very perſon, yet he was in office and dignity concerning the title of the birthright, and the bleſsing was due vnto Iacob, and the meaning of this enunciation (I am Eſau thy eldeſt ſonne) is this: I am he, to whom is due the dignity and office of the byrth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right And this phraſe of ſpech, Chriſt him ſelfe vſed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayd of Iohn <hi>Ipſe eſt Helias,</hi> he is Helias.

The ſame fertility alſo is noted in the marueilous plentyfulnes of the women of Egypt, for wher, in other places it chaunceth not very oft, that women bring forth two twyns at once, in Egypt one woman doth bring forth three or foure children at one burthen.

<pb facs="tcp:7195:168"/> But what the nature of Aungels is, it cannot exactly be expreſſed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mortal man. For ther are many things in the order of creatures, the nature of whom cannot be perfectly declared: yet not with ſtanding they may ſomwhat be opened vnto the capacity of our vnderſtanding. Some do ſay, that Aungels are good ſpirites, miniſters of a fierie nature, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſeruice of God and of good men. Other ſay, that Aungels are heauenly ſpirites, whoſe ſeruice &amp; obſequy God vſeth, to execute al ſuch thinges as he hath decreed. VVherfore we ſhall not be much diſceiued, if we ſay, that Aungels are good ſpirites and heauenly, I meane vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſubſtaunces, created for the miniſtery of God and man.</p>
                     <p>The ſcriptures both prophetical and Apoſtolicall witnes it, that the Aungels were created of God. For Paule reciteth that ſentence of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> who maketh his Aungels ſpirites, and his Miniſters a flame of fire.

Vvherfore theſe heretickes lyed which ſayd, that the Aungels were helpers of the creation, and are coeternal vnto the God of all things. For God made both the Aungels &amp; all other creatures in time through his ſonne. But concerning the tyme, when they were made and created, whether it were together with the light, before man or after man, and after all the reſt of the woorkes of God, let him declare that knoweth any certaintye of it, more then the ſcriptures do teache. The auncient Expoſiters of the ſcriptures, as Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius and Auguſtinus, do confes nothing to be found in the Scriptures concerning that thing. But that which is not touched in the ſcriptures, is not wythout daunger enquired of, but it is wythout daunger to bee ignoraunte of it. It is ſufficiente to knowe, that the Aungels were made, at what time ſoeuer they wer made. Let vs rather geue God than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that he hath created ſuch excellent Miniſters for mankinde. Let vs lyue an holye and an angelicall life in the ſighte of the holy aungels.

But what maner of bodies they were, whoſe ſhape they tooke vpon them, or from whence they tooke them, or wher they laid them downe again, after they wer diſcharged, it is very hard to be declared.<note place="margin">cap. 59.</note> Saynt Auſtin in his Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion which he wrote vnto Laurentius ſaith thus: who can expres with what bodies the aungels appeared vnto men, which were not onely ſene, but alſo touched and felt, and againe brought certain viſions, not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſubſtaunce, but of a ſpiritual power, to be ſene not of the corporall and bodely eyes, but of the ſpiritual eyes, and of the mynde, &amp; that they ſpake not vnto the eare outwardlye, but inwardly in the mindes of men, being ther them ſelues placed. As it is written in the booke of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the aungel of the Lord told me, which ſpake in me: for he ſayth not, which ſpake vnto me, but which ſpake in me. And they did appeare in their ſleepe, and talked with men in their dreames. For we reade in the Goſpell: Behold, the aungell of the Lord appeared vnto him in hys dreame, ſaying. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By this meanes the Aungels declared them ſelues not to haue pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable bodies.

For what needeth it, that thoſe things, or ſuche like ſhoulde be affirmed, ordeined, or defined wyth daunger, wher as we may be ignoraunt of them without fault or blame? Thus far ſaynt Auguſtine.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe and like cauſes let vs acknowledge the omnipotency &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous diſpenſation of him, who doth what things he will, vnto whom it is no harde matter to create ſubſtaunces meete and agreable vnto hys purpoſe, whereas he made of naught, al viſible and inuiſible creatures.

Affirming ſtiffely both in word and in dede, Baptiſme onely to appertayne vnto the adult, and not vnto infantes. Notwithſtandyng they vſed a farre other trade and vſage, then they whiche in our time dwelling in the lower Germany and in Belgica, brought in agayne the hereſie of the Anabaptiſtes For they toke awaye from infantes not onely their Baptiſme and their faith, but alſo their ſaluation and the kingdome of God, whiche they iudged to pertayne onely vnto them that are baptized and beleue. For theſe are their wordes as they be rehearſed by Petrus Cluniacenſis: He that bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaued. Theſe wordes of Chriſt do playnly ſhew, that no man, except he beleue and be Baptized, that is, except he profeſse the Chriſtians faith, and receiue his Baptiſme, can be ſaued: for it is not one of them alone, but both together whiche doth ſaue. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon although infantes be Baptized of you, yet notwithſtandyng, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not able throughe their tender age to beleue, they can in no wiſe be ſaued. But theſe men in our tyme (whiche opinion was neuer heard before) teach and beleue, that all infants, yea the children of the Paganes and infidels without any other meanes at all, and without any pledge of grace, are ſaued, and obtayn the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the death and Paſsion of Chriſt. And this hereſie, although it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled for a time, and tooke place among a great multitude in Fraunce, yet notwithſtanding, as concerning the error of the Baptiſme of infants, and the rebaptizing of ſuch as were of adulte age, it fayled and ſurcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For the Valdenſes, whiche otherwiſe were called Picardi (of whoſe ſecte there is a great number remayning in Morauia, and in other places of Bohemia nighe vnto it) although they noted many abuſes and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in the Romiſh Churche, for the whiche cauſe, at this day they are ſeperated from the communion and felowſhip of that Church, yet they both alowe the Baptiſme of infantes to be agreable vnto the Scriptures, and alſo vſe it and put it in practiſe. VVherfore this errour lay a ſleepe vntill this our age, before that in the yeare of our Lord. <hi>1522.</hi> one Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Munſerus a phantaſticall and a ſeditious man ſowed firſt the ſeede of this hereſie, whiche afterwarde multiplied and increaſed exceding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and infected the mindes of many men, beyng of an immoderate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate zeale towarde God.

After y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of this Memno one Theodoricus Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus tooke his parte, being a man of no leſſe zeale then he was, of lyke eloquence, but of greater learning &amp; knowledge: whiche certaine bookes ſet forth by him of late yeares, doo declare, in ſo much that it is to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that ſo good a witte, adourned with ſo many good dowries, did employ his ſtudy rather to eſtabliſh an hereſie, and to maintain ſciſmes, then aduaunce and enlarge the true Churche. Although he be not ſo euill as ſome of the ſame ſecte be, and doth correct certain abſurde and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous errours of theirs: The folowers of this Memno, to whom ſucceded Theodoricus, were for the moſt parte, all they whiche dwelling in the parts of Belgica, and the partes of the lower Germany, maintained this Anabaptiſticall hereſie. In whom a man may perceiue the argumentes and tokens of a godly mynde, whiche being ſturred through a certayne blinde zeale, haue ſwarued from the true ſenſe of the Scripture, rather through ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through malice, which thing may well appeare by this, that they did alwayes moſt earneſtly reſiſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions &amp; ſturres of them of the Citie of Monaſteir, and of the towne of Baten, who ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to place a certayne new kind of the kingdome of Chriſt, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the wicked by externall force &amp; power, teaching the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorning and enlarging of the Church to conſiſt onely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as theſe be, may ſeme worthy rather of pitie and correction, then of perſecution and vtter deſtruction. Vnto whom the ſaying of Saint Auguſtine diſputing of the Manachies, may be wel applied, whoſe wordes are theſe: Although God ſubuerte and ouerthrow the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and falſe kingdomes, he willeth notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the men the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, for ſo much as they are men, to be amended, rather then to be deſtroyed. VVhich thing alſo Saint Auguſtine affirmeth of the wicked Donatiſtes and the Rogatiſtes, ſaying: that they were like in this vnto the Iewes, whiche had a zeale towarde God, but not accordyng to knowledge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onely thoſe, whiche with a frowarde minde did fight agaynſte the truth, knowyng it to be the truth. VVhoſe impietie doth paſse idolatrie, agaynſt the whiche ſinne there was a mortall puniſhement ordeined, but bycauſe a man cannot eaſely be conuicted of that crime, which lieth hid in the harte, therfore he iudgeth that all men rather ought with lenitie to be corrected, and no ſeueritie to be ſhewed, but onely vnto ſuch as are vnquiet and troubleſome, whom Saint Auguſtin notwithſtandyng in an other place would haue rigorouſly puniſhed by feare and the ſworde of the Emperour. &amp;c.

                     <p>The outward vaile doth ſignify the couering of thoſe miſteries which pertain to the church militant, and therfore this vail was rent in pieces: to ſignify, that thoſe miſteries which pertain to the church, were reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the death of Chriſt. But the inward vayle was not then deuided, nor rent aſunder, bicauſe the ſecretes of the heauenly kingdome do yet remaine vnreuealed, wherupon Paul writeth to the Corinthians ſaying: <hi>Cum autem Iſrael conuerſus fuerit ad deum, amouebitur velamen.</hi> VVhen Iſrael ſhalbe turned to God, the vayle ſhalbe taken away: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all the miſteries which were written in the law and the prophets, were made open by the paſsion and death of Chriſt. As it is written in the Euangeliſt Luke, how that Chriſt began from Moſes &amp; al the prophets, interpreting to the two diſciples,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> all the ſcriptures which were written of him. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The foure coulours in the vayle do ſignify the foure elements.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by the twined linnen, is ſignified the earth, bicauſe linnen doth grow out of the earth.</p>
                     <p>By purple is ſignified the water, bicauſe the purple coulour is made of certaine ſhelfiſh, which are found in the ſea.</p>
                     <p>By the blue coulour is ſignified, the aire, bicauſe it hath the coulour of the ayre.</p>
                     <p>By ſcarlet is ſignified, the fire. And therefore, bicauſe the matter of the foure elements, is an impediment and let (by the which impediment, incorporal ſubſtances are hidden from vs.) The high prieſt alone by him ſelfe went into the holieſt of all, and that but once in the yere, to ſignify that the final perfection of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be broght at the laſt to that world, which is the world of glory.</p>
                     <p>The vayle alſo may ſignifye by theſe foure coulours, foure ſpirituall miſteries. The fine linnen doth ſignify the purity of the fleſh. The purple doth figure the croſſe and troubles which holy men do ſuſtaine for Gods cauſe. The ſcarlet doth ſignify double charity, that is, the loue of god, &amp; the loue of our neighbour. The blue coulour doth ſignify heauenly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Other learned men do make this allegory of the vayle, when it was rent in the middle, at the death of Chriſt. The renting of the vayle doth ſignify, that the way vnto God the father is made open by the death of Chriſt, alſo that the fiery ſword is remoued from the doores of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and that thoſe things be throwen downe and deſtroyed, which dyd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7195:176"/> ſeperate vs from God: and that thoſe thinges are nowe made open which before were hidden, that is, that the Gentiles are now made coheires &amp; partakers of the kingdome of God. For it was ſayd before: <hi>Notus in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea deus, in Iſrael magnum nomen eius.</hi> God is knowen in Iewry onely,<note place="margin">Pſal. 76.</note> and in Iſrael great is his name: but now it is ſayd, from the riſing of the Sunne, to the going downe of the Sunne. <hi>Laudabile nomen domini,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 113. Mat. 10.</note> the Lords name is to be praiſed. And wher Chriſt before his death did ſay to his diſciples, <hi>In viam Gentium ne abieritis,</hi> go not into the way of the Gentiles. After his death he ſayd: <hi>Euntes docete omnes gentes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mark. 16.</note> go and teache all nations.</p>
                     <p>Origine ſpeaketh of two vailes, as Paule alſo doth to the Hebrues. The firſt vaile is rent in peces and taken away,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.</note> but the ſecond vaile doth remain, &amp; doth couer thoſe things which we ſhal ſee in the life to come.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> For here we know onely but in part, but ther we ſhall know perfectly.</p>
                     <p>In fine, Moſes &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets are now made perſpicuous, clere &amp; plain.</p>
                     <p>Note one thing concerning the ſtory, which is, that the vayle was rent in two peces in the middeſt.</p>
                     <p>The Iewes when they heard any wickednes and blaſphemie agaynſt God, they rent their clothes. And ſo did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the temple of God, for it rent his clothes, that is, the vaile, being aſtonied, and hauing great indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for thoſe iniuries which were done vnto Chriſt. And not without cauſe, when the true temple of the Lords body, in whom all fulnes of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelt corporally: was diſſolued by death. The figurall temple doth rent his vayle, and in a maner mourne and lament the ruine of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temple, that is, of the body of Chriſt put to death.</p>
                     <p>To end, by the renting of the vaile, the Iewes wer admoniſhed, that al their legal ſacrifices ſhould then ceaſe, &amp; that ther ſhould be no more vſe of the old prieſthood. And although the edifice of the temple did yet ſtand ſtil, yet God ſhould not be worſhipped ther after the olde accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med maner. Alſo, bicauſe the ſubſtaunce &amp; truth of thoſe ſhadowes was now found, all the legall figures were turned into the ſpirite.</p>

He ordained him his chief gouernour, and had him in great honour, partlye bicauſe he perceiued in him a comely beuty and great wiſdome, partly bicauſe he vnderſtode to be in him the intelligence of al viſions and dreames. For when Daniel ſtoode in the kings ſight, euery word that the king demaunded of hym, he anſwered ſo, that it did excel and paſſe ten times the anſwers of other ſouthſaiers.

Yet this is ſo to be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that grace is in the ſoule, and not in viſible ſignes, &amp; for that ſo great a cauſe they are called the veſſels of grace. They maye alſo be called the veſſels of grace by an other reaſon, which is this: As that which is in the veſſel, is not of the veſſel, nor commeth thereof, yet it is drawen out of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: So grace is not of the ſacraments, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of them, but ſpringeth of the eternal fountain, of the which fountain the ſoule ſeketh in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.

                        <p>A concubine is called in the Hebrue toung <hi>Pilaegaeſch</hi> that is, a mayden ioyned to a man without wryting, that is, without contract, or betrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet ſhe was counted a true wife in the holy Scriptures, as it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth in Cethura, who was called Vxor, a wife, <hi>Et addidit Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, &amp; accepit vxore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; nomen eius Cethura, &amp; peperitei Zimran. &amp;c.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Geneſis. 28</note> Now Abraham had taken him another wife called Cethura, which bare hym Zimran, And in the ſame Chapter ſhe is called alſo a concubine, where it is ſayd, that Abraham gaue all his goods to Iſaac, but vnto the ſonnes of the concubines, whiche Abraham had, he gaue giftes, and ſent them away to the Eaſt countrey.</p>
                        <p>Here may you ſee, that the concubines among the Hebrues were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiues, although they were oftentymes handmaydens, as Agar, Bala, Zilpa and others.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the ciuile ordinaunces of the places where the fathers dwelt, the free men could not contract matrimonie with their handmay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therfore it might be, that in the holy Scriptures, they be called Concubinae concubines, and not wiues, notwithſtanding before God they were wiues.</p>
                        <p>There be two differences betwene the lawes of the Romaines, and the lawes of the Iewes. Firſt the Romaines counted not Concubinatum, to be matrimony. Among the Iewes it was counted matrimonie before God.</p>

                        <p>Secondly the Iewes had their handmaidens to their concubines, the Romaines would not haue that to be lawfull.</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted, that where it ſeemeth in the decrees, concubines to be approued and allowed, they are to be vnderſtande of thoſe, whiche were wyues in deede, that is, when both parties do conſent and agree to dwell continually together, and to acknowledge eche other as man and wife. Otherwiſe concubines be vtterly forbidden.</p>

                        <p>Ye ſhall finde, that Abraham had two ſonnes, that is Iſmaell of Agar, and Iſaac of Sara.</p>
                        <p>Both were the true ſonnes of Abraham, Iſmael was no leſse the true ſonne of Abraham then Iſaac, for both came of one father, one fleſh &amp; one ſeede. VVhat is than the difference? this maketh not the difference (ſaith Paule) bicauſe one of the mothers was a free woman, &amp; the other a bonde woman (althoughe it maketh for the allegorie) but bycauſe Iſmaell whiche was borne of the bonde woman, was borne of the fleſhe, that is without promiſe and without the worde of God, but Iſaac was not onely borne of the free woman, but alſo accordyng vnto promiſe. VVhy ſo? notwithſtandyng Iſaac was borne of the ſeede of Abraham aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as Iſmaell. I graunte they were both the ſonnes of one father, and yet there is a difference, for although that Iſaac was borne of the fleſhe, yet there went before a promiſe and a nomination of God. This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Paul would haue to be noted. He gathered this difference in this maner out of the text of Geneſis.</p>
                        <p>That Agar conceyued, and brought forth Iſmael, it was not the voyce and the worde of God, which had foretold that this ſhould come to paſse: but by the permiſsion of Sara, Abraham went vnto his handmaid, Agar, whom Sara beyng baren (as Geneſis witneſseth) gaue him to wife. For Sara had heard,<note place="margin">Gene. 16.</note> that Abraham by the promiſe of God ſhould haue ſeede of his body. Vnto this ſeede ſhe hoped, that ſhe ſhould be mother: but when ſhe had many yeares looked for this hope, after the promiſe was made, ſeyng the matter to be differred, ſhe thought her hope to be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. VVherfore this holy woman doth yelde vnto the honour of her huſband, and her owne ryght, reſignyng her ryght vnto another and that vnto her handemayd, yet ſhe doth not ſuffer her huſband to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7195:185"/> another wyfe without his houſe, but ſhe geueth her owne mayden vnto hym in matrimonie, that ſhe myght haue children in her owne houſe. For ſo hath the Hiſtory of Geneſis.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sara vxor Abraham non genuerat illi,</hi>

                           <hi>ſed habens ancillam Egyptiam nomine Agar, dixit marito ſuo: Ecce, concluſit me dominus, ne pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, Ingredere quaeſo ad ancillam meam, ſi forte ex illa aedificer, &amp; cete.</hi> That is to ſay. Sara Abrahams wyfe bare hym no children, and ſhe had a mayde, an Egyptian, Agar by name. And Sara ſayde vnto Abraham: beholde nowe, the Lorde hath reſtrayned me from childebearyng. I pray thee go in vnto my mayde, it may be that I ſhall receyue a chylde by her. &amp;c. It is a great humilitie, that ſhe ſo much directed her ſelfe, takynge in good parte this temptation of her fayth. She thought thus with her ſelfe, GOD is no lyer, what he hath promiſed vnto my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, that will he ſurely performe, but perchaunce God will not haue me to be the mother of this ſeede, I wyll not enuye Agar thys honour, vnto whome lette my huſbande goe in, perchaunce I maye haue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by her.</p>
                        <p>VVherfore Iſmaell is borne without the woorde, onely at the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sara her ſelfe, for there is no woorde of God whiche commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or promiſed Abraham a ſonne, but it ſeemeth all to be done by chaunce, whiche the woordes of Sara declare. If perhaps (ſayth ſhe) I maye haue a chylde by her. Since that therfore there preceded no voyce of God vnto Abraham, as there did when Sara ſhould bring forth Iſaac, but the voyce of Sara onely goeth before, it is ſufficiently ſhewed, that Iſmaell was the ſonne of Abraham accordyng to the fleſh, onely without the woorde. Therefore he was looked for and borne lyke vnto any other chylde. This thynge Sainte Paule diligently pondered and weyghed.</p>
                        <p>He vrgeth alſo the ſame argument vnto the Romayns, which here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding in an allegorie, he doth repete &amp; ſtrongly conclude,<note place="margin">Rom. 9</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonnes of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not the ſonnes of God. Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſayth he) hath two ſorts of ſonnes: the one ſorte are borne of his fleſhe &amp; bloud, but the woorde and the promiſe of God goyng before, the one as Iſaac, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſort with out the promiſe, as Iſmaell. Therfore (ſayth he) the children of the fleſh are not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of God, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of promiſe. &amp;c. And with this argument he ſtoppeth the mouthes of the proude Iewes: as Chriſt doth alſo in Mathewe and in Iohn,<note place="margin">Math. 3. Iohn. 8.</note> who glorified them ſelues to be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſeede of Abraham. As though he ſhould ſay, It foloweth not. I am the carnall ſeede of Abraham, therfore I am the ſonne of GOD. Eſau is the naturall ſonne, therefore he is the heyre. They that will (ſayth he) be the ſonnes of Abraham, they, beſides their carnall birth, muſt be the children of promiſe and belief. And they that haue the
<pb facs="tcp:7195:186"/> promiſe and beleife, are onely the true children of Abraham, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſonnes of God.</p>
                        <p>But Iſmaell bycauſe he is not promiſed of God vnto Abraham, is onely the ſonne of the fleſhe, and not of promiſe, and therefore he is looked for and borne as other children are. For no mother knoweth whether ſhe ſhall haue any childe or no, or if ſhe perceyue her ſelfe to be quicke, ſhe knoweth not whether it be a manne or woman childe, but Iſaac was certaynely named. <hi>Sara vxor tua inquit Angelus ad Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>

                        <p>Abraham is the figure and token of God, who hath two ſonnes, that is, two peoples repreſented by Iſmaell and Iſaac. They were borne vnto hym, of Agar and Sara, who do ſignifie the two Teſtamentes, the olde and the newe.</p>
                        <p>The old Teſtament is of mount Sinai, begettynge bondage whiche is Agar, for the ſame hill whiche the Iewes call Sinai (whiche ſemeth to haue his appellation of Buſhes, brambles and briars) the Arabians call in their toung Agar. VVhiche thing beſides Paule, Ptolomie doth alſo witnes, and the Greke ſcholies. After the ſame manner there are geuen diuerſe and ſondrie names vnto other hilles alſo, amonges diuerſe nations.

                        <p>It doth well agree, that the mount Sinai in the toung of the Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hath the ſame name that a handmayd hath, &amp; I think, that the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of that name miniſtred vnto Paule an occaſion and lyght to ſeeke out an allegorie. Therfore as Agar the handmayd, brought forth vnto Abraham a ſonne in dede, yet not an heyre but a ſeruaunt. So Sinai the allegorical Agar, brought forth truly vnto God, a ſonne, that is a carnall people. Alſo as Iſmael was the true ſonne of Abraham, ſo the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell had God their true father, vnto whom he gaue a law, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his oracles, religion, the ſeruice of him and his Temple, as it is in the Pſalme.<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.</note>

The ruminating or chewing of the cud, is iudgement. for euery thing is not to be admitted, which we ſee &amp; heare, but thoſe things onely, which we with a diligent examination weigh, &amp; conſider, and find them not to be repugnaunt vnto God and his law.</p>
                     <p>Afterward, ther are adioyned ſundry liuing things in a certain cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge or number by their kindes, of which it was vnlawfull for the people of God for to eate. Theſe were either foure footed beaſtes of the earth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſtes of the water, or birds of the ayre, or creping things.</p>
                     <p>Of foure footed beaſtes of the earth, ther are foure namely forbidden: The Camel, which hath a high and long neck, teaching pride and aroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by al meanes to be aduoided. Alſo the Cony or the Mouſe of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by the which is ſignified, that ſuch men as are drowned in earthly things, are not allowed of God. The Hare, being a fearful beaſt, doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh vs to put away al daſtardly cowardnes, as the ſwine all filthines and vncleanes. For the Hog is a figure and token of al impurity, wherof roſe this prouerbe: <hi>Sus ad volutabrum.</hi> And it is written of Cyrces, that ſhe turned through her enchauntments,<note place="margin">2.

If they did lacke either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they wer forbidden, as the Ele, which although it haue ſinnes, yet it hath no ſcales. For as the bodies of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes are gouerned by their fynnes: ſo it behoueth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be gouerned with a ſtedfaſt fayth. The ſcales are hard, and couer the bodye, ſo except we be conſtaunte, and pacient in the worke of the Lorde, he doth worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorre vs.</p>
                     <p>Of the foules of the ayre, ſuch as are moſt rauening and ſpoyling, are forbidden, and ſuch as feede vncleanly, and deſire filthye meate. Alſo ſuch birds as flye onely in the twy light, and in the night, aduoyding the day light, and ſuch as are ſubtill, vnſtable, and nothing quicke. By the which the contraries, as beneficiency, abſtinence, temperaunce, alſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, clearnes, conſtancy, alacrity, integritie, and cleannes of lyfe are commended vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>Finally, not a few of the creping beaſtes are noted. For men which ar altogether ouerwhelmed in filthines, diſpleaſe god. I wil not reherſe the names of al the beaſts which wer forbidden, partly bicauſe it had bene a buſy matter, partly, bicauſe the Expoſitours of the Bible do wonderfully vary &amp; alter in the interpreting of them, in ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not inogh mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uel of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extreme blindnes &amp; frowardnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, in the earneſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing of the choiſe of meats, wheras the Rabbines in this place are darke and obſcure, nor can declare certainly, what thoſe beaſtes be, which God hath forbidden them to eate.</p>

They would not ſuffer a poore man to eate an egge on the Friday, or in the Lent, and other their preſcribed daies, vnles he had a pardon from the Pope. Yea, if a man being ſicke and ready to die, had taſted of any kinde of fleſh, with out their diſpenſations &amp; pardons, he ſhould haue bene curſed with bel, booke, and candle, as blacke as a coale down to hel.

                     <p>Conſider I pray you, how ſaint Auſten in his boke <hi>De moribus eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae,</hi> painteth out, and moſt manifeſtlye deſcribeth the faſt of the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, to be ſuch a faſt as is now adaies the faſt of our Papiſts (that is to ſay) gluttony, &amp; not a meanes to tame the fleſh, as they do pretend. And that the ſober diet of the chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eating ſparely of fleſh, is the right kinde of faſting. Thus ſaint Auſten reaſoneth: if there be a man (as it is poſsible) ſo ſpare of diet, &amp; profitable withal, that he wil eate but twiſe in one day, ruling and tempering with that abſtinence, the appetite of his throte and belly. And be it alſo (ſaith he) that ther be ſet at ſupper be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore this man, a few herbes, &amp; a litle bacon ſodden with the ſame herbs, ſo much in quantity, as may ſuffice to put away his hunger, &amp; that the ſame man quench his thirſt with three or foure draughtes of pure wine, that is vnmingled with water, and that this be his dayly diet.

                     <p>VVhat manner of man, Spiridion, was about the entertaynement of ſtraungers, it appereth by this that followeth: In the beginning of Lent, a certaine ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iourneing, came vnto him, who was without meate .v. daies. Spiridion ſeing the ſtraunger very weake, ſaid to his daughter, go and waſh the ſtraungers feete, and ſet meate before him. And when the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin had ſaid that ther was neither bread, nor meate in the houſe (of the which he was wont then to haue no ſtore, by reaſon of the faſt) Spiridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on firſt praying and aſking pardon, commaunded his daughter to ſeeth pork, which he had in his houſe ſalted, which being ſod, he ſitting with the ſtraunger, did eat of the fleſh ſet before him, and requeſted, that the ſtraunger would eate with him. VVho refuſing, and profeſsing himſelf to be a chriſtian, therfore (ſaith Spiridion thou oguht not to refuſe, for to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cleane al things are cleane, as the woord of God hath taught.</p>
                     <p>I do not bring in this doctrine to that end, that I would ſet althinges on cocke and hoope (as they ſay) or that I do meane, that the euangelical liberty, ſhould be turned into carnal liberty, or that men might eate at al times all maner of meates, without obſeruation of the lawes of Princes, made for a common wealth: but I ſpeake it for this end, that we ſhould not put anye religion or righteouſnes, or anye vnholynes in the meates them ſelues, for they be neither of, nor on, as ſaint Paule writeth to the Corinthians, ſaying: <hi>Atqui eſca nos non commendat deo,</hi> and meate doth not commend vs vnto God.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, that the true ſeruice of God, iuſtification, and remiſsion of ſinnes, be not put in them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they are not to be counted ſo neceſſary &amp; inuiolable, but that they may be chaunged, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtate of the faithful ſhall ſo require.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, they ought not to be made in ſuch ſorte, that if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal

Furthermore, our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries in this their decree of the choiſe of meates, doo accompt a certayne holines, and ſeruice of God to conſiſt, in ſo much, that they eſteme them, which do not abſtain from ſuche meates, which they haue preſcribed, to be leſſe holy, leſſe good, and leſſe religious. Afterward theſe their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces ſo encreaſed, and multiplied out of meaſure, that neither almoſt ther was any end of them. Saint Auſten complained that in his time all thinges were full of ſuperſtitions, ſo that the condition, and ſtate of the Chriſtians was wors, then the ſeruitude of the Iewes. Vvhich thing, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>much as, he ſpake of his time, what, I pray you woulde he ſay nowe of our time, the church being oppreſſed with ſuch infinite burdens.

They brought in the imbering daies, foure times in the yeare, alſo the vigils of many ſaintes, in the which not to faſt, Gregory the ſeuenth, made it mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne. Since that, therfore theſe traditions are ſo greuous vnto the church, that they may be called in tollerable burdens, which Chriſt did reprehend, to be layd vpon mens backes of the Scribes &amp; Phariſies, thei ought not to be tollerated, and ſuffered.

Furthermore, God praiſed their duty done vnto their father, whom they wer bound in moral life, and in maners to obey, for he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded theſe things vnto them, as ciuil, proper, &amp; peculiar badges of his family, and not vnder the title of religion. For when they wer bidden of Ieremy to drinke wine, they did not prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a holines or a ſeruice of god, that they would not conſent vnto him: they declared onely what their father had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Furthermore, the Saboth is an externe and outward ordinance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for God would deliuer vnto vs in this precept, an outward religi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on and worſhipping of God, in the which we ſhould all be exerciſed.

For therfore is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſt commaunded, that the ſpiritual operation might not be let &amp; hindered by the corporal actions. This operation of the ſpirite with the fathers, was occupied about foure things, that is, in reading, interpreting and hearing of the ſcriptures, in priuate and publike prayer, in celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſacramentes and ſacrifices, and in collecting and diſtributing to the poore. In theſe pointes conſiſted the outward keping of the Saboth: for the people (al buſines laid apart, and being at reſt) gathered them ſelues together into the ſinagoge, wher the prophets did read, and interprete the word of God, and did inſtruct the auditory in true godlynes. After this, the faythfull prayed together with one accord and common aſſent, for all their neceſsities. They praiſed the name of god, and thanked him for all his benefites. Furthermore, they offered ſacrifice according vnto the word of god, celebrating the miſteries and ſacraments of god, and ſo exerciſed their fayth.</p>
                     <p>And they were admoniſhed of their office and dutye, and that they ſhould offer them ſelues a liuely ſacrifice vnto god.

Theſe truly were the holy workes of God, which as long as they vſed, being inſtructed in faith and charity, thei did ſanctify the Saboth, and the name of the Lord, that is, they perfourmed thoſe workes in the Saboth, which doo both ſanctifye the name of God, and alſo adourne the doers of them, &amp; they are verily the workes, which are holy and acceptable vnto God. If thou require a manifeſt and worthy example, and paterne of the Saboth or feaſt truly ſancttified, thou ſhalt finde it in Nehemias,<note place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> for ther the prieſtes expounde and interprete the word of God, they praiſe his name, they pray with the people, they offer ſacrifice, they are liberal in their gifts, and finally behaue them ſelues ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and religious in al pointes</p>

God will haue a time and place reſerued for religion. Theſe muſt nedes be hindred by external labours.

Therfore we are plucked away from the religion of the Sabbaoth, through our beaſtes, from the which, leaſt we ſhould be let and troubled, it is commaunded, that we ſhould permit our cattell to take their reſt.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all God bringeth an example, by the whiche he teacheth vs to keepe holy the Sabbaoth. Becauſe (ſayth he) in ſixe dayes the Lord made heauen, and earth, the ſea, and all that in them is, but the ſeuenth day he reſted, therfore God bleſſed the ſeuenth daye, and hallowed it. God laboured ſeuen dayes in creatyng the heauen, the earth, the ſea, and all that is therin, but in the ſeuenth day he reſted, conſecrating a certain appoynted day to reſt in. In the ſeuenth day, we muſt conſider the works, which God did the ſixe dayes before. The children of God muſt call to remembraunce, what, and how great benefites they haue receyued the whole weeke before. Then God is to be thancked, prayſed, and to be learned in his worckes. VVe muſt conſecrate vnto hym our whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule, and we muſt conſecrate vnto hym all our ſayinges, and doynges. The Lord reſted from creating, but he reſted not from preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and gouernyng ſuch thinges as he had created. VVe muſt reſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from handie and bodilie worckes, but we muſt not ceaſſe from ſuch worckes as pertayne vnto the worſhipping of God. VVherfore, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine reſt hurted not the thinges created, and reſtyng, and ſeruing of God in the Sabbaoth day, wilbe no hynderaunce vnto our worldly buſineſse, and affaires: for God bleſſed the Sabbaoth, he will therfore bleſſe thee and thy houſe, thy doynges and all thy poſſeſsions, if thou be carefull to kepe holy the Sabbaoth of the Lorde, that is, if thou do thoſe worckes whiche he commaunded to be done vpon the Sabbaoth. They do erre
<pb facs="tcp:7195:194"/> therfore and are much deceyued, whiche deſpiſe the religion and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt of the Saboth, and call it an vnprofitable idlenes, and do labour in the Saboth day like as they do in other prophane dayes, pretendyng the care and neceſsitie of their familie.</p>
                     <p>All theſe thinges muſt be applyed alſo vnto vs Chriſtians, and to our Churches. It is moſt certaine, that the ſpirituall Saboth is before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges commaunded vnto Chriſtians. Neither is it to be doubted, but that god wil hau a iuſt ordre to be obſerued in our churches as wel as afore tyme in the Churches of the Iewes, and eſpecially an exerciſing of externall Religion, we knowe that the Sabboth is ceremoniall, in that, it is ioyned wyth Sacryfices and other Iudaicall ceremonies, and in that, it is tyed vnto a certayne tyme: but in that Relygion and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, is furthered in the Saboth daye, and a iuſte order is retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Churche, and charitie keept with our neighbour: It is morall and not ceremoniall: we muſt in this tyme alſo ſpare our familie, and we muſt in theſe dayes inſtruct our houſhold in Religion. God did no where diſsipate or put a ſonder the holy congregations, but he chiefly gathered them together. As there ought to be a certayne place, ſo there ought to be a certayne and a preſcribed tyme, conſecrated vnto the exerciſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and therfore there muſt be a holy rest alſo. Therfore the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churche chaunged the day of the Saboth, least they ſhould ſeeme to be like the Iewes, and to ſticke vnto ceremonies, and celebrated the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt the next day after the Saboth day,<note place="margin">Apoc. 1.</note> whiche Saint Iohn calleth Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minica, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, the ſonday, or the day of the Lord, becauſe God in that day gloriouſly roſe agayne from the dead. And although the ſonday is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in no place of the new Teſtament, yet becauſe in the fourth precepte of the firſt Table, the care of Religion and the exerciſe of the externe worſhippyng of God is earneſtly required, it were contrary to godlines and Christian charitie, not to ſanctifie the ſonday, eſpeciallie ſince this externe worſhipping cannot conſiſte without an appoynted tyme of holy rest. The ſame is to be thought of certayne other feastes and holy dayes dedicated vnto our Lord Christ, in the whiche we celebrate the memoriall of his natiuitie, incarnation, circumciſion, paſsion, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, his aſſention into heauen, and the ſendyng downe of the holy Ghost vpon his Diſciples. For this is not the Christian libertie to breake and violate Eccleſiasticall and godly obſeruations, whiche helpe and ſet foorth both the glory of God and the charitie of our neighbour. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord will haue holy dayes onely vnto hymſelfe, ſuch feſtiuall dayes as are dedicated vnto creatures, are not to be allowed This glory and ſeruice onely appertayneth vnto God.<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> Saint Paule ſayth, I will not that any man ſhould iudge you in the parte of any festiuall day or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7195:194"/> whiche are but the ſhadowes of thinges to come. And in an other place he ſayth. Ye obſerue dayes and monethes, tymes, and yeares. I feare leaſt I haue bestowed my labour vpon you in vayne. And therfore we haue nothyng to do at this tyme with the obſeruation of the Iewes, in the Churche of Chriſt Let vs keepe onely the Christian obſeruation, and the exerciſe of Christian Religion.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>¶ The ſanctifieng of the Saboth of the Chriſtians.</head>
                        <p>The ſanctifieng and exerciſe of our Sonday, doth conſiſte alſo in foure thinges, whiche must be founde in the holy congregation of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if it be holy in dede.</p>
                        <p>First, all holy men ought to enter into the Church, where the Goſpell muſt be expounded and declared, by the which the auditory may learne what to thincke of God, what is the true ſeruice of god, &amp; how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God may be glorified. Next there muſt be petitions and prayers made in the congregation for the neceſsities of all men. VVe muſt extolle the goodnes of God geuing thanckes for his dayly and ineſtimable benefites. And (if the tyme, occaſion and cuſtome of the Churche do ſo require) the Sacramentes muſt religiouſly be celebrated: for it is chiefly required in this fourth precept, that we ſhould diligently obſerue and deuoutly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the holy Sacraments, and rites of the Churche, beyng lawfull, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and neceſſarie.</p>
                        <p>Finally, humanitie, and beneficence muſt take place in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, al men muſt learn dayly to be beneficial in geuing of almes priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to be moſt liberall publiquely, whenſoeuer the neceſsitie of the tyme, and oportunitie ſhall ſo require.</p>
                        <p>By theſe offices and duties, the Saboth is alſo ſanctified in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churche, especially, if there be added vnto this a continuall ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of an vpright and innocent life.</p>
                        <p>This diſcipline and order is aſwell to be vſed in euery houſholde of the fathers and maiſtres among the Chriſtians, as among the Iewes. Of the whiche matter it is not nedefull to make many wordes, where as I haue ſo intreated of this place a litle before, that it is agreable in all pointes vnto our Chriſtian Churche. This onely will I adde at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that it is the office of a chriſtian Magiſtrate, or at the leaſt wiſe of a good father, to bring and keepe in order all ſuch as do violate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Sabboth of the Lord, and his diuine ſeruice. The chief of the Iewes and the people of God by the commaundement of God, ſtoned to death one that contemptuouſly gathered ſtickes on the Sabboth daye.<note place="margin">Num. 15.</note> VVhy therfore is it not lawfull for a chriſtian Magiſtrate, to puniſh in body, goods, or lyfe the deſpiſers of Religion, and the true and lawfull ſeruice of the Sabboth? If that in this corrupt and wicked tyme the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent
<pb facs="tcp:7195:195"/> Magiſtrate do not his dutie, yet euery father and maſter muſt endeuour, that his familie be not wicked, let hym puniſhe his owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes by ſuch lawfull meanes and wayes as is permitted vnto him: for it is lawfull for euery houſeholder, although he dwell among Idolaters to gather a holy congregation in his owne houſe, (as we read that Loth did in Sodome, and Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob, in the land of Canaan, and in Egypt.) And it is a great offence and a detestable ſciſme, if when lawfull companies and conuenticles be aſſembled together in townes &amp; villages, a Chriſtian man ſhould deſpiſe the Churche of Chriſt and the congregation of Saintes, as the Anabaptiſtes do.</p>

                        <head>The abuſe of the Sabboth.</head>
                        <p>Here is requiſite, that we recite the abuſes and offences committed agaynſte this commaundement. They offende agaynſte this precepte, whiche ceaſse not from euell worckes, yea rather abuſe this holy reſt, vnto the entiſement and pleaſures of the fleſhe: for ſuch keepe not the Sabboth of God, but they ſerue the deuill in playeng at dice, in eatyng and drynkyng, in daunſing, and followyng other vanities of the world, by the whiche worcks, we are not onely ledde awaye from the holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation but pollute and defile our owne bodies, whiche we ought to ſanctifie. They offende alſo whiche exerciſe handye worckes in the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, or wrapped and couchyng in their beddes, ſleepe much parte of the day, neglectyng the congregation of God. They offende, whiche bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyng their ſeruauntes with labour, let them from the ſeruyng of God, preferryng other corruptible and filthy thynges before the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of God. But they offende moſt of all, whiche do not onely not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Sabboth, but are an occaſion alſo vnto others by their impure tauntes and euill example of prophanyng the holy day, whiche diſprayſe and diſdayne the holye rites, the miniſtery, the Miniſters, the ſchooles, &amp; al godly exerciſes. And all gouernours of houſeholdes offende greatly agaynſte this precepte, if they do not their diligence to vſe, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the ſanctifieng of the Sabboth in their houſes: VVho ſoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Religion of the Sabboth, do geue an euident teſtimonie in them ſelues of impietie and contempte of God. Therefore, the obſeruation and contempte of the Sabboth, hath greate promiſes and threatninges in the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>For the declaration of the whiche thyng, I will recite the wordes of Ieremie, whiche are theſe: Thus hath the Lord ſayd vnto me, go, and ſtande in the gate of the children of the people, wherby the kynges of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah come in, and by the whiche they go out, and in all the gates of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, And ſay vnto them: heare the words of the Lord, ye kinges of

Thus ſayth the Lord: take hede to your ſoules, and beare no burden in the Sabboth daye, nor bryng it in by the gates of Hieruſalem, neyther cary foorth burdens out of your houſes in the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day, neyther do ye any worcke, but ſanctifie the Saboth, as I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded your fathers. But they obeyed not, neyther enclined their eares, but made their neckes ſtiffe, and would not here, nor receiue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Neuertheles, if ye wil here me (ſayth the Lord) and beare no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den through the gates of the Citie in the Sabboth day, ſo that ye do no worcke therin, then ſhall the kyngs, and the princes entre in at the gates of this Citie, and ſhall ſitte vpon the throne of Dauid, and ſhall ride vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the charettes, and vpon horſes, both they and their princes, the men of Iudah and the inhabitauntes of Hieruſalem, and this Citie ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne for euer, and they ſhall come from the Cities of Iudah and from about Hieruſalem, &amp; from the land of Beniamin, and from the plaine, &amp; from the mountayns, and from the South, which ſhal bring burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringes and Sacrifices, and meate offringes and incenſe, and ſhall bryng Sacrifice of prayſe into the houſe of the Lord. But if ye will not here me to ſanctifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sabboth day, and not to beare a burden, nor to go through the gates of Hieruſalem in the Sabboth day, then will I kindle a fire in the gates therof, and it ſhall deuoure the palace of Hieruſalem, and it ſhall not be quenched. Hetherto Ieremie.</p>
                        <p>Not without good cauſe therfore Leo, and Anthemius beyng religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous princes, writing vnto Armaſius, commaunded hym in theſe wordes: That the feſtiuall dayes beyng dedicate vnto the excellent maieſtie of God, ſhould neyther be occupyed in paſtime &amp; pleaſure, neyther be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned in exacting of tributes.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe we decree, that the ſonday ſhalbe reuerently honored, that it ſhalbe excepted from al buſines. In this day let no ſuretyſhip be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let no man be ſummoned to appeare, let no pleadyng be vſed, and let no cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or matters of controuerſie be heard &amp;c. And a litle after it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. Neyther do we ſuffer, that this day (beyng exempted from all trauell) ſhould be ſpent in wantonnes, and filthy delightes, let there be no enterlude or pagent played one the dominicall day, nor any game or paſtime in the place of exerciſe called Circus, nor the lamentable ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of wylde beaſts, yea although the ſolemnitie of our birth happen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this day, let it be deferred. If any man on this day ſhall haue any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe vnto ſpectacles, or vnder the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of publique or priuate affaires, ſhalbe an apparitor or ſergeant to any Iudge, violating and breakyng theſe ſtatutes, let him ſuſtayne, let hym leeſe the commoditie of warfare,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:196"/> and runne into the daunger of preſcription &amp; atteinder.</p>
                        <p>But in the meane time, the Christian men do not forget theſe words of Christ in the Gospell. The Sabboth was made for man, and not man for the Sabboth.<note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> And therfore is the ſonne of man Lord alſo of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both. The godly do vnderſtand, that the Sabboth was inſtituted of God, to conſerue, and not to destroy man: and therfore the Sabboth is to be diſpenſed withall, as often as it ſhalbe through our neceſsitie or health ſo required.<note place="margin">12. Cap. 6. et 13. cap.</note> Of the which thing our ſauiour Christ diſputeth in Mathew and in Luke, for in ſuch thinges the libertie of the Christians doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiste. And wheras the Priestes and Leuites are excuſed openly ſlayeng of beastes in the Temple, ſkinning, ſeething and burning them, that is, preparing their Sacrifice in ſuch ſorte, that they be not counted gilty of the breach of the Sabboth. In like ſort it ſhalbe lawfull to prepare meate for our neceſsitie on the Sabboth day, and to feede the body. It ſhalbe lawfull alſo to heale the ſicke, to viſite the impotent and diſeaſed perſons, to ſuccour the nedy, that we may preſerue the creature of God. In this, the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of our ſauiour Christ doth inſtruct vs, executing the workes of charitie and mercy on the Sabboth day. Of this there are ſondry exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the Hiſtory of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Luk. 6. et. 13. Iohn. 5.</note> but eſpecially in Luke and Iohn. If it be lawfull to plucke a beast out of the dich or mier on the Sabboth, why is it not lawfull on the Sabboth to post and ſuccour an olde houſe beyng ready to fall to the ground? VVhy is it not lawfull vpon the Sabboth, to gather together or cary in haye or corne, whiche hath layne abroad a long tyme, and to ſaue it, leaſt it ſhould through the iniury of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther periſhe, and be vtterly deſtroyed? Conſtantine the Emperour in his ſtatutes writing to Elpedius, ſayth thus: Let all Iudges and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of the Cities, and all offices and craftes, ceaſſe, and be at rest vpon the Sonday. But the people of the countrey may ſometimes frely and lawfully attend their tillage and ground: becauſe it oftentimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, that the corne cannot be committed vnto the earth, nor the vyne tree be ſet in the trenches more commodiouſly and conueniently on any other day. And let not the commoditie which is geuen by Gods prouiſion, periſh through the occaſion of a momentary or ſhort tyme. Theſe be the woordes of Conſtantine. He doth not permit vnto the men of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, al maner of violatyng of the Sabboth: for it is required alſo of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſerue God, and that they do not breake this fourth precepte, but they haue a libertie graunted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their vrge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t neceſsitie, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, godlines, and charitie ought to be our beſt maiſters, and to diſpenſe with vs in this caſe, leaſt vnder the pretence of libertie and neceſsitie, we exerciſe impietie, and do the workes of couetous, and not of religious perſonnes.</p>

                        <p>Thirdly, the Sabboth hath a miſticall ſignification: for it is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall token, that it is God onely whiche doth ſanctifie his worſpippers, for thus Lord ſpeaketh vnto Moſes: Thou ſhalt kepe my Sabothes, be cauſe it is a ſign betwixt me &amp; you vnto your posterities, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye may know that I am the Lord whiche doth ſanctifie you. And the rest as followeth in Exodus. And it is repeted in Ezechiel.<note place="margin">Exod. 13. Ezech. 20.</note> To this vſe it doth alſo conferre it cauſeth mutuall helpe and charitie, whiche was ſpoken of before in the declaration of the ſecond vſe: for God doth ſanctifie his faithfull through the holy Ghost, the whiche thyng he declareth vnto his Churche by the worde of his Goſpell, whiche he testifieth and ſealeth with his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: and he commaundeth vs, to deſire of hym this ſanctification with continuall prayers.

Hereupon Saint Luke writeth, that the people and publicanes whiche were Baptiſed at Iohns preaching,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> did iuſtifie God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, iudged, confeſsed, and prayſed God to be iuſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this worde <hi>Iuſtificari,</hi> to be iuſtified, ſignifieth alſo a man to be allowed for doing well, the whiche ſignification S. Iames vſeth, when he concludeth, that Abraham was iuſtified by workes, and not by faith onely, becauſe God praiſed Abraham for his obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do by the offering vp of his ſonne, and alſo confirmed the promiſe of multiplieng Abrahams poſteritie, and geuing him a bleſsed ſeede which was our ſauiour Chriſt. This iuſtification was coumpted nothing els but a prayſe and rewarde of his well doyng, and not receyuinge of hys per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonne vnto grace and ſtate of adoption by his worckes. It is manifeſt therfore, that this worde is taken alſo to ſignifie a mans good cauſe to be allowed, that is, for any man to be prayſed and rewarded of GOD for ryghteouſnes and obedience done vnto hym.<note place="margin">Cap. 22</note> VVe ſee this worde to be ſo vſed of Saint Paule, when he wrote that the hearers are not iuſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but the doers of the lawe. Likewiſe we ſee it to be vſed in the Apocalipſe, for to profite in righteouſnes. Therfore, to be iuſtified by worckes, ſignifieth to obtayne remiſsion, and to be ryghteous and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto God by our owne power and dedes, which is a falſe doctrin. But contrarywiſe to be iuſtified by faith in Chriſt, ſignifieth to obtayne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, &amp; to be coumpted righteous, that is accepted to God, not by our owne powers, but by the fre grace of our mediatour, the ſonne of God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Iuſtificare,</hi> to iuſtifie, ſometime is vſed for <hi>Excuſare,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,<note place="margin">Cap. 44</note> as in Geneſis, <hi>Quid loquemur? &amp; quo nos iuſtificabimus?</hi> that is what ſhall we ſpeake? and how can we iuſtifie and excuſe our ſelues? And in Luke.<note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Ille autem volens iuſtificare ſeipſum, id eſt, expurgare. &amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay. And he willing to iuſtifie, that is, to cleare him ſelfe. &amp;c. Agayne in Luke,<note place="margin">Cap 16.</note> Ieſus ſaith to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phariſeis. <hi>Vos eſtis qui iuſtificaſtis vos coram hominibus. &amp;c. id eſt, exiſtimaſtis vos probos, iuſtos,</hi> that is, you are
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7195:197"/> they, whiche haue iuſtified your ſelues before men. &amp;c. that is, haue thought your ſelues to be good and iuſt men.</p>
                     <p>Therfore properly iuſtification is none other thing, than a remiſsion, reconciliation, or acceptation of a perſon to eternall life, that is iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſignifieth remiſsion of ſinnes, a quiet conſcience, and a ſure hope of eternall life giuen frely by the onely mercy of God.</p>
                     <p>The iuſtifications of God are the wordes of his promiſes, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we beleue, we are iuſtified before God, like as we be condemned for bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lyes. Pſalme. <hi>Vtinam dirigantur viae meae ad cuſtodiendas iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones tuas,</hi> that is. O, that my wayes were directed to kepe thy ſtatutes, that is to ſay. O that my wayes were right, that is, the affection of my harte, and my conuerſation, and that I might not be ſeduced with ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge doctrine, with other mens commaundements and with other ſtatutes.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saint Paul in the Epiſtle to the Hebrues calleth not, <hi>Iuſtificationes,</hi> the word and promiſes of God, but he calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare iustification after a ſorte, although they do not geue it, as are the Sacrifices, and purifications of the law.</p>
                     <p>Saint Luke ſemeth to put, <hi>Iuſtificationes,</hi>

O idol ſhepheard that leaueth the flocke. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Churche is no more proued by the continuall ſucceſſion of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, ſpeciallye as oft as they doo not preach the woord of God, nor do the office of paſtors, than if there were a great number of idoles ſet foorth to the face of the world to proue the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Who can deny, but that the moſt part of the Romiſh Biſhops after Gregori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Magnus, were ſuche lyke Idolles, ſuche maner of Wolues, and deuourers as Zachary deſcribed?</p>
                     <p>In the old church of Iſrael the order of Biſhops was common, &amp; the ſucceſſion was vnbroken from Aaron, to Vrias, and from him to Achas, and to other wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Biſhops that ſwarued to idolatry.</p>
                     <p>But that ſucceſſion did not proue thoſe idolatrous biſhops to be true paſtours, neither their church to be the true church of God.</p>
                     <p>The prophets, Orthodoxes, and Catholickes, teaching the pure word of God, could not rehearſe a ſucceſſion of prieſts, that went before them, and yet they were moſt bright lights of the church, and they which beleued their preaching, wer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led neither ſchiſmatickes nor heretickes.</p>
                     <p>When Chriſt taught vpon earth, and gathered the church, the aduerſaries had the ſucceſſion of Biſhops, which wer before them: but they therfore ruled not the true church, and Chriſt the heretical church.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtles of the Lord could not ſhew for them and their doctrine a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Biſhops going before them, for they were appointed of the Lorde, whom God made biſhop for euer, after the new order of Melchiſedech, without the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Leuitical order. And yet notwithſtanding the Churche gathered of them, is knowen to be a holy and a true church.</p>

                     <p>It is concluded therfore, that the continual ſucceſſion of Biſhoppes can proue nothing of it ſelf, yea, and that it is not a iuſt ſucceſſion, that lacketh the purity of the apoſtolicke doctrine, and the right vſe of the ſacraments,</p>
                     <p>Tertullian greatly eſteming, and that worthely, the continuall ſucceſſion of Paſtours in the Church, requireth notwithſtanding the ſame to be approued by the ſincerity of the apoſtolike doctrine, and willeth the Churches to be inſtructed with pure doctrine, neither he acknowledgeth them for apoſtolikes, which could onely alledge the ſucceſſion of Biſhops. His wordes be theſe. <hi>Caeterum ſi quae au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent interſerere ſe aetati apoſtolicae, vt ideo videantur ab apoſtolis traditae, quae ſub apoſtolis fuerunt, poſſumus dicere: Aedant igitur origines eccleſiarum ſuarum, euol uant ordinem epiſcoporum ſuorum. &amp;c.</hi> That is: But if anye hereſies dare inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingle them ſelues vnto the time of the Apoſtles, that therfore they maye ſeeme to be deliuered of the Apoſtles, bicauſe they were vnder the Apoſtles, we may ſay thus: Let them ſhew the beginnings of their churches, let them ſearch the order of their Biſhops ſo diſcending from the beginning by ſucceſſions, that the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop haue for his author and anteceſſour ſome of the Apoſtles, or ſome of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike men, which notwithſtanding haue perſeuered with the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>After this manner the apoſtolicall churches did ſhewe their cenſures. As the church of the Smyrneis (hauing Polycarpus placed by ſaint Iohn) reporteth, as alſo the church of the Romaines (hauing Clement appointed of Peter) recordeth. <hi>Ita ex ipſo ordine manifeſtatur, id eſſe dominicum, et verum quod ſit prius traditu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: id autem extraneum et falſum, quod ſit poſterius immiſſum. Ea ſententia manebit aduerſus poſteriores quaſque haereſes quibus nulla conſtantia de conſcientia com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit ad defendendam ſibi veritatem.</hi> That is. It appeareth by the very order, that that is of the Lord, which hath bene firſt deliuered, and that to be ſtraunge &amp; falſe, which hath bene laſt put in. This ſentence ſhal remaine to ſerue againſt all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that ſhall come hereafter, which wyl agree with no ſtedfaſt conſcience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the truth.</p>
                     <p>Let the heretickes pretend any ſuch thing (for what thing doo they thinke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for them to do after their blaſphemy) but they do faine, they ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. For their doctrine being compared wyth the apoſtolicke doctrine, wil vtter, and ſhew it ſelfe by the diuerſity therof, that it hath neither Apoſtle, nor any apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke man to be the author. For like as the Apoſtles taught not diuers thinges among them ſelues, ſo alſo none of the apoſtolickes woulde haue ſpoken thinges contrary to the Apoſtles, vnles it were they whiche ſwarued from the Apoſtles, and taught otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>After this maner therfore, ſhall be prouoked from them vnto thoſe churches, which (although they bring foorth none of the Apoſtles or apoſtolickes for their author, as whiche ſucceded longe after, and dayly are inſtituted) yet neuertheleſſe condeſcending and agreing in one faith, they are to be counted apoſtolicke for the affinity of the doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, other churches alſo do exhibite and geue what originall of the apoſtolicke ſeede they had which were conſtituted Byſhops of the Apoſtles. Thus farre Tertullian.</p>

                  <p>The Counſel of Conſtantia<note place="margin">Counſel of Conſtance. 19.</note> conſented, that the halfe part of the Sacrament ſhould be miniſtred to the lay people.

For Hierome writeth to Euagrius. <hi>Si authoritas quaeritur, maior eſt orbis vrbe.</hi> If authority be aſked, the world is greater then the Citye. So the whole churche is greater then the church of Rome, being but one Church. Secondly, that Councel condemned this article. The Pope is not aboue al churches, by the law of God.

                  <p>It is about <hi>.900.</hi> yeares ago, ſince the Councel of Conſtantinople aſſembled in Leo the Emperors time, decreed, that Images ſet in the Churches, ſhoulde be broken in peeces.</p>

                        <p>Simonides a Poet very famous for his learning and wiſdome, being demaunded of Hiero king of the Siracuſanes, what God is: firſt that he might pronounce ſome certainty of ſo hidden a matter to be diſcuſſed, he deſired the ſpace of one whole day, to be geuen vnto him to try his wits, and to beate his braines about it. Vvhen this day was ended, Simonides being aſked againe the day following of Hiero, what he did thinke that God was. He required two daies more of deliberation to be geuen him. After this maner the time being ſpent to no purpoſe, Simonides alwaies deſiring his daies to be doubled, when Hiero marueiling aſked him, for what cauſe in al this time he gaue him no anſwer vnto his queſtion: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaith he) how much the more I conſider, ponder, and ſearche the matter, ſo much the more hard, obſcure and hidden it ſeemeth to be. By this example we are taught, not to be curious in ſearching and boulting out the arcane miſteries of the diuine godhed, vnto the which the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity of mans wit cannot reach &amp; attain. For it is a vain thing to deſire to know theſe things which a man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not compas. Caeleſtial things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, and impenetrable vnto mortall creatures. God is to be ſought with faith, &amp; not with reaſon. Reaſon is of no power in diuine things, wher ther is nede of a ſincere faith and purity of the mind. As the eye is daſeled at the beames of the ſon, ſo is the ſharpnes of the mind dul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led &amp; diſmaied at the contemplacion of the diuine maieſty, wherof thou maiſt perceiue diuers through an vnſaciable curioſity to attain to know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge &amp; wiſdome, to haue fallen into deteſtable errors. Vvherfore ſince we are preſerued by the onely faith in Chriſt, &amp; not by the ſtrong opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the philoſophers, &amp; by the miſtical ſpeculations of the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I thinke it better, &amp; more ſafely for a chriſtian man to be ignorant of ſomthings, then to be ouer wiſe, for as in al other things, ſo in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of wiſdome a meane is to be prayſed. And they that are ouerwiſe, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly moſt foliſh, wheras a chriſten man ought rather to endeuour to liue wel, then to clime to high, in matters paſsing his reache.</p>

                        <p>what ſoeuer miracles are done, either by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> angels or by any other meanes from aboue, commending and ſetting forth vnto vs the honour and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of God onely, in whom is euerlaſting life, it is to be beleued of them whiche loue the aungels (according vnto truth and godlines,) that thoſe miracles are wrought of them and by them, by Gods operation working in them. And a litle after he ſaith. And when the aungels here vs, God him ſelfe hereth in them as in his true Churche, not made with handes. And agayne he writeth,<note place="margin">Cap 16.</note> If any aungels deſire Sacrifice, let them be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred whiche ſerue not them ſelues, but God the creatour of all thinges: for by this they ſhew, what a loue they beare towarde vs, when by Sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice they would make vs ſubiect, not vnto them ſelues, but vnto hym, through whoſe contemplation they are happie, and they deſire to bryng vs vnto him from whom they neuer departed.</p>
                        <p>Although this be ſufficient to aunſwere to al the obiections touching angels, yet for perſpicuities ſake I will adde this diſtinction. That which is proper and pertayning onely vnto the Lord, is attributed vnto the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Vt remotiori cauiae,</hi> as to Gods meſsengers and Miniſters, for as it is written in Exodus:<note place="margin">Exod. 23.</note> 
                           <hi>Nomen meum eſt in medio illius.</hi> and what other thing is this to ſay, but that which the angel doth, he doth it by my name, by my vertue, commaundement, and power. Saint Stephen ſayth in the Actes of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Actes. 7.</note> when fourty yeares were expired, the aungell of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7195:207"/> the lord appered vnto him (Moſes) in the mount Sina, &amp; a litle after he ſaith: <hi>Et facta eſt vox Domini ad eum:</hi> And the voyce of the Lord ſayth vnto him, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Iacob. Here ye may ſee, that he called him God, whom a litle before he called aungell, becauſe he meaned that the angell did that which he did, in the name and commaundement of God. To this appertaineth that place, where it is ſaid, that the aungell of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the Citie of Hieruſalem, when he ſlew of the hoſt of the Aſsiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans an hundred foure ſcore and fiue thouſand men.</p>
                        <p>Agayne the aungels in many places did beare the type, and did ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Lord, wherupon ſaith Auſten: <hi>Clamauit ad eum Dominus de ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, dominus in Angelo, an dominus Angelus ille, qui dictus eſt magni conſilii angelus, &amp; intelligitur Chriſtus,</hi> that is. The Lord cried vnto him out of the buſhe, whether it were the Lorde in the aungell, or that aungell was the Lord, who is called the aungell of the greate counſell, and is vnderſtand Chriſt?</p>
                        <p>This you may ſee, that deliueraunce, &amp; redemption &amp; ſuch like ar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed in the Scriptures vnto angels, for they be attributed for Chriſt, and in Chriſt. So in this place, for aſmuch as benediction was promyſed vnto Abraham, Iacob could not better expreſse the faith of his mynde, than with theſe wordes: the aungell whiche hath deliuered me from all ill, bleſse theſe children. He vnderſtode the aungell of the great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, the Lord Ieſus, who is benediction, ſaluation, rightouſnes and the ſanctification of his people.</p>

                        <p>In the Prophet Zacharie, the aungel of the Lord is ſayd to complaine, and to be greeued for the exile of the people of Iſraell, yea and to pray vnto the Lord to haue mercy vpon the people.</p>

Micheas prophecieng before the kings Achab and Ioſaphat, cried out ſaying: I ſaw the Lord ſit vpon his throne, &amp; al the hoſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſtode by him, on his right hand, and on his left hand. And the Lord ſayd, who will entiſe Achab, that he may go and fall at Ramoth Gilead, and one ſayd on this maner, and an other ſaid on that maner. Then there came forth a ſpirit, and ſtode before the Lord, and ſayd, I wil entiſe him. And the Lord ſayd vnto him: wherwith? and he ſaid: I will go out, and be after
<pb facs="tcp:7195:208"/> a falſe ſpirite in the mouth of all his Prophetes. Then ſayd the Lord: thou ſhalt entiſe him, and ſhalt alſo preuaile, go forth, and do ſo. &amp;c. Nowe, this was not done in deede in ſuch ſort, as the Prophet deſcribeth. But it is, <hi>Hypotypoſis,</hi> a figure to ſhew forth a mater before the eies, as it wer done in deede. For who will gather of theſe wordes of the Prophet, that God did communicate with ſpirites? and to vtter his decrees one after an other, after the maner of men? It is ſufficient, if by a certaine collation or compariſon, we vnderſtand by this ſuffiguration, God to be angrie with Achab, and therfore purpoſed by iuſt iudgement, and by lyeng Prophets to bring him to deſtruction, which would not geue eare to the truth.</p>

The Lord (ſaith he) hath caſt me into this calamitie, not by the reaſon of my wickednes, but through his owne good will, now his aduerſaries, and eſpecially Eliphas doth reply and ſay, that God puniſheth none but for ſinne, yea &amp; that al men be ſinners, and none cleane in the ſight of God.

The Cananit alſo ſhould be ſhameles,<note place="margin">Math. 15</note> which with ſo great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy cried and deſired helpe of Chriſt, and not of the Apoſtles, inſomuch that they at the length being weary of her crying, ſayd: Send her away, for ſhe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the heauen with her cry, and wearieth al mens eares.</p>
                        <p>Now let vs heare what the Lord himſelfe pronounced of this impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of ſynnes and ſinners.</p>
                        <p>To the ſynfull woman he ſaid: <hi>Fides tua ſaluam te fecit, vade in pace,</hi> That is: Thy fayth hath ſaued thee, go thy way in peace. To the Cananite he ſayd: <hi>O mulier, magna eſt fides tua, fiat tibi ſicut vis.</hi> O woman, great is thy faith, be it done to thee as thou wylt.

It is a ſure ſaying, &amp; worthy by al meanes to be embraced of vs, that Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſinners.</p>
                        <p>Againe he ſaith: <hi>Habentes ergo pontificem magnum qui penetrauit caelos. &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay.<note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> Vve hauing an high prieſt which pearced the heauen, Ieſus the Sonne of God, let vs holde the confeſsion and fayth.

                        <p>They thinke it to be an vnwoorthy thing, that a ſinfull man ſhould thruſt him ſelf firſt into the ſight of Chriſt: but vnleſſe we do come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt with this confidence of faith, our ſaluation is loſt, we ſhal not be clenſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne.

                        <p>Thou ſeeſt how he put her backe when others prayed for her, but when ſhe her ſelfe praied and cryed for the gift, he graunted it vnto her.

Let vs ſee therfore who ought to be inuocated of them that pray, truly
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7195:215"/> no man, but God onely and alone. For thre thinges are required of hym that is prayed vnto.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, that he do heare the praiers of all men that be in the whole world, that he perce their harts, and do narrowli behold them, adde alſo this, that he do knowe al the praiers of men, better then the men them ſelues can declare.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, that he be preſent in al places, &amp; that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do althings in heauen, earth, &amp; hel, which knoweth al waies &amp; meanes to help me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                        <p>The third is, that his wil be very prompt and ready, that he wyl alſo do that he can do.</p>
                        <p>But theſe condicions are found onely in God. For god alone ſearcheth the raines and the hartes. He alone heareth and ſeeth all things, he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knoweth more perfectly the things that are within and without a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than doth the man himſelfe: He alone is preſent in al places, he onelye is omnipotent, he onely is wiſe, the moſt perfect will of God onelye geueth good thinges to man, and his wil is alwaies readye, and onelye doth moſt faithfully procure that which is profitable to man. Therfore God alone muſt be inuocated.</p>
                        <p>NVho is he that can attribute theſe condicions to the ſaintes in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, without blaſphemy and ſacriledge? Therfore the ſaints liuing in hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen with God, ought not to be inuocated, chieflye for that the ſcripture with plain words teſtifieth, that Abraham &amp; Iacob knew vs not, and it commaundeth vs to call vpon God, and prohibiteth vs to communicate thoſe things that pertaine vnto God, to creatures.</p>
                        <p>To be ſhort, to which of the ſaints liuing in heauen, can we ſay w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ſhame: Our father which art in heauen, &amp; as foloweth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lords praier?</p>
                        <p>Let vs therfore inuocate &amp; cal vpon god alone that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, to whom al the ſaints y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer wer in the church did praye.

Theſe be the waies of God the father in which he commaunded him to walke, theſe are the preceptes that he commaunded him to kepe, and he faithfully did that God bad him to do. For he taught that ther is a true God, and that he alone ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, neither at any time he called him ſelfe God, for he ſhoulde not haue obſerued his fidelity toward God the father, being ſent to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſtraunge Gods, &amp; to affirme to be but one God, if he ſhoulde haue brought any other biſide one God.</p>

                        <p>Alſo he ſayth thus: Seing that the father maketh the ſonne, and the ſonne the father, there is but one minde, one ſpirite,<note place="margin">Cap. 29.</note> and one ſubſtaunce to them both. But the father is as it were a plentifull wel or fountaine, and the ſonne is as a riuer flowing from him, the father is as the ſunne, &amp; Chriſt as the beame extended from the ſunne.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Athenodorus the Philoſopher, which liued verie fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarlie with Augustus the Emperour, being of great age &amp; of many yeares, had obtained a ſafe conduct or paſseporte of the king, to departe into his countrie, the laſt day whiche he minded to leaue Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> geuing thanks vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor, taking his leaue, &amp; entring into his iourney, amongs other things he left this profitable &amp; worthy precept &amp; admonition vnto Auguſtus, as a monument and token of him ſelfe beyng abſent. At what time (O Caeſar ſayth he) anger ſhall ſtirre and moue thee, ſpeake thou or do nothing before thou haue rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thy ſelfe the <hi>.24.</hi> Letters of the Alphabete in order. At theſe wordes Auguſtus beholdyng him with a chearefull countenaunce, and ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king him gentlie by the hand, ſaith in this ſorte: O frend Athenodorus, I haue geuen thee leue to depart into thy countrie at thy requeſt, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with thy hore head and olde age. But ſeyng that I haue more nede of thi preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce now tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue had before this, let it not be greuous vnto thee
<pb facs="tcp:7195:218"/> at my requeſt likewiſe, to deffer thy haſty iourney vntill an other tyme. VVherfore Athenodorus was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrayned to tary a yeare longer in Rome with Auguſtus. By this leſson I gather, that there can be nothing well done whiche is done with an vnquiet and angry mind. VVherfore angry and wayward men, being prone and geuen of them ſelues vnto irefull paſsions, are vnfit to haue any publique affaires in their handes, but are to be reſtrayned and kept backe from all offices and gouernementes, as troubleſome perſonnes and prone to moue debate. For it is vnlikely, that he which is throughly kindled with anger, will kepe him ſelfe within the boundes of equitie and iuſtice: for the angrie man differeth in no other pointe from a madde man, but that the angrie man is madde but a tyme, vncircumſpect and to raſhe harted. Many men by anger, haue done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges, of whiche it earneſtly repented them afterward, for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce is the fellowe companion of anger. Anger hath puniſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed many men, yea and hath caſt downe men, that otherwiſe were worthy and noble, from the high eſtate of worldly felicitie vnto extreme miſerie. Furthermore it hath vexed and deſtroyed many Cities, much people and many realmes and countreis. VVherupon ſome do ſaye, that a wrathfull man becauſe he is alſo out of bis witte, is not to be reputed and taken for a man, but for a fearce and brute beaſt. For what other thyng is man, when witte and reaſon is taken awaye, but a mere beaſt. VVhat a monſter and miſerable thing may we thincke that to be, which tranſformeth a man into a brute beaſt? It is a moſt vnworthy thyng for a man to degenerate ſo farre from him ſelfe and from his owne nature, that he be diſpoſseſsed from the right title of this name, man. VVe muſt therfore dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly labour, not onely to ſtriue againſt, but alſo to our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to ouercome this euell, this peſtilence ſo foule and ſo hurtfull to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And firſt of all let vs ſet the mekenes and pacience of Chriſt, which is to be folowed of all men, againſt wrath and anger, which is an euident and plaine ſhare of Sathan, wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he goeth about to catch and to draw vs into the nette of deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If we do folow the doctrine &amp; example of Chriſt with ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deſire, we ſhall not cauſe other men to rage and to be angrie. And being prouoked and ſtirred our ſelues, we ſhall boldly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all maner of wrathfull affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For he may be thought to be a good and true chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man, that (caſting all his hope and care vpon god in the variable and ſondry chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of this deceiptful world) can with much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſuffer a like both right and wrong. And if any proſperitie chaunce, he geueth all prayſe to god: and if aduerſitie do happen, he remitteth all reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gement to god. Alſo neither he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be moued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the veritie by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges or promiſes, nor by violence or flatterings: but beyng alwayes one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, regard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Mekenes is a frend to brotherly charitie, but anger is an enimy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whiche charitie no man can be a Chriſtian.</p>

                     <p>Nor this counſell ought to be contemned, as though it wer a trifle, vayne and nothing worth. For Theodoſius alſo the elder Emperour of Rome.

                        <p>Therfore whether we be whole or riche, let vs not ſtand to much in our own conceites, vpbraydyng them that be diſeaſed and ſtricken in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, foraſmuch as we know not certaynly, how long we ſhall continew in one ſtate our ſelues.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat this Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was called Britannia of Brutus, certain learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do ſay is nothing likely. All the old Latin hiſtoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s agre, that the ſonne of Siluius the ſecond in ſucceſsion from Eneas, and of them named the ſonne of Aſcanius, was Eneas, called alſo Siluius, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Grekes do alſo accorde, but they name Siluius to be brother to Aſcanius, and borne after the death of Eneas, and was therfore called Poſthumius. But neither the Romaines nor the Grekes do write of any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called Brutus, before Iulius Brutus, whiche expelled Tarquinus out of Rome, which name was alſo geuen vnto him by the ſonnes of Tarquine in deriſion, becauſe they tooke him to be foliſh &amp; dullwitted. Moreouer there is ſo much diuerſitie betwene Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nia and Brutus, that it ſemeth agaynſt reaſon that the one ſhould procede of the other. For if Brutus had ben the geuer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt name to this Ile, he would haue called it Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia or Brutica, rather than Britannia, whiche hath no maner propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or analogie with Brutus.</p>
                     <p>S. Thomas Eliot writeth of this matter as followeth: I will declare a reaſonable cauſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture, why this Ile was named Britannia. About <hi>30.</hi> yeres ſince it happened in wilſhire at Iuie church about <hi>2.</hi> miles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſbury, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> digged to make a fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d an hollow ſtone co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with an other ſtone, wherin they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a booke hauing in it litle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue <hi>20.</hi> leaues (as they ſaid) of very thick velime wherin was ſome thing written. But when it was ſhewed to Priestes and chanons whiche were there, they could not read it. VVherfore after they had toſsed it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one to an other (by the meane wherof it was torne) they did neglect and caſt it aſide, long after a piece therof happened to come to my handes, whiche notwithſtanding it was all to rent and defaced, I ſhewed to M. Richard Pace, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chief Secretarie to the kings moſt royal maieſtie, wherof he ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cedingly reioiſed. But becauſe it was partly rent, partly defaced &amp; blou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red with wet which had falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on it, he could not find any one ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding after long beholding, he ſhewed me, it ſeemed that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid booke contained ſome auncient monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this Ile, &amp; that he per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued this worde Pritannia to be put for Britannia, but at that time he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7195:220"/> ſaid no more to me. Afterward <hi>I</hi> geuing much ſtudie and diligence to the reading of hiſtories, conſidering wherof this worde Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nia firſt came, finding that all the Iles in this part of the Ocean were called Britanniae, after my firſt coniecture of Albion, remembring the ſaid writing, and by chaunce finding in Suidas, that Prytannia in Greke with a circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flexed aſpiration doth ſignifie mettals, fayres, and markets, alſo reuenues belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon treaſure: <hi>I</hi> than conceiued this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Grekes flouriſhing in wiſedome, prowes, and experience of ſayling, being entred into the Ocean ſea, found in the Iles great plenty of Tynne, Lead, Yron, Braſse, and in diuers places gold and ſiluer in great qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie, they called all thoſe Iles by this generall name Prytannia, ſignifieng the place, by that whiche came out of it, as one would ſay, he went to market, when he goeth to Anwarpe or Barrowe: or to the fayre, whan he goeth to Sturbridge: or to his reuenues when he goeth to any place, from whence his reuenues come. And yet becauſe this Ile excelled the other in euery condition, it was of ſome priuately called Albion, that is to ſay, more hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>py or richer. This coniecture approcheth more nighe to the true ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, than the other inuentions, except there be any auncient hiſtory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of Geffrie of Monmouth or Beda, which may more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie confute that I haue declared. To ſuch will I gladly geue place. Finally I thought it alwayes more honorable to haue receyued the firſt name by ſuch occaſion as I haue rehearſed: And the generation of the inhabitaunts of this land to be either equall with the moſt auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or mixed with the moſt wiſe &amp; valiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t people of Greece, va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhers and ſubduers of Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take the name and firſt generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a vaine fable or of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if any ſuch were, which after he had ſlayne his father wandred about the world, vncertain where to dwel. Alſo to aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vs to come of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Troianes, cauſers of their own cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by fauouring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduoutry of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, of whom neuer proceded any other notable monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but that they were alſo breakers of their othe and promiſe. Yet this follie is found al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all people, whiche contende to haue their progenitours come firſt out of Troye. VVhiche fantaſie may welbe laughed at, among wiſe men: Thus farre Syr Thomas Eliot.</p>
                     <p>The faith of Chriſt was receiued in this realme (as Gildas in his hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſaith) in the time of Tiberius y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, vnder who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt ſuffred. Some Chronicles do ſay, that Ioſeph of Aramathia came hether and prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched here. Polidorus Virgilius writeth, that when the Apoſtles were diſperſed, Philip the Apoſtle beyng in Fraunce,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. hiſto.</note> ſent this Ioſeph hether into England with no ſmall traine, in the yeare of our Lord <hi>.63.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beda writeth that in his tyme, here in Britaine, Eaſter was kept in the full moone, on what day in the weeke ſo euer it fell,<note place="margin">Polychro. lib. 5. cap. 17.</note> and not on the ſonday after, as we do now. VVherfore it appeares, that theſe preachers

                     <p>Euery perſon that doth offer is of more worthines than the thing which he offreth. The prieſt doth offer the body of Chriſt.

                     <p>The ſimilitude of nouriſhing is this: that as bread and wyne do nouriſh our body and comfort our outward man, ſo the body and bloud of Chriſt be the meate and foode of our ſoules, and do comfort our inward man.</p>
                     <p>The ſimilitude of vnitie is this, that as the loafe of whiche we eate, was made of many cornes of wheat by the licour of water knoden into dough, and yet is but one loafe, and as the wine was made of the iuice of diuerſe grapes, and yet is but one cup of wine, ſo all they that eate Chriſtes body and drincke his bloud, beyng many, are made one body and one fleſh by the liquour of charitie and loue, are made (I ſay) the miſticall body of our ſauiour Chriſt, whiche is his Church, not his naturall body. for the bread is a ſacrament, not onely of Chriſtes naturall body, but alſo of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and miſticall body.

So they ſay, that Elizeus chaunged and altered the nature of yron, when he made it to ſwimme aboue the water. So they ſay, that Elias chaunged the nature of fire, when thoroughe his prayer it fell from heauen, and conſumed his
<pb facs="tcp:7195:222"/> ſacrifice of woode, ſtones and duſt. The nature of fire was chaunged, no man can denye it, at what tyme God appeared vnto Moſes out of a buſhe in a flame, for the buſhe was not conſumed. He commaunded the fire not to hurte his faithfull ſeruauntes Sidrach, Miſake and Abednego, and preſerued them harmeles from the hote burning ouen. There agayne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was altered. Elias and Elizeus did not turne, alter or chaunge the very ſubſtaunce, and inwarde eſsence or matter, either of yron, or of the fire, into any other ſubſtaunce or nature, but the natural propertie of them making the yron, which is heauy to houe aboue the waters, and cauſing the fire which is light to diſcend downward.

Before, it was common bread and wine, now it is holy and ſanctified, before it was no Sacrament, nowe it is a Sacrament of the bleſsed body and honourable bloud of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. But for a more manifeſte proufe that the olde fathers bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſubſtaunce of bread to remaine after the conſecration, I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſome of them. Ireneus ſayth, that euery Sacrament is made of two natures, of a heauenly nature, and of a terrenall or earthly nature.

But yet is it receiued vnder both kindes, which auaileth vnto both, bicauſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both Chriſt wholy is receiued. But if it ſhould be receiued vnder one kinde, it ſhould be ſignified, that it doth profit onely one part, that is, either bodye or ſoule, and doth not auaile to the tuition of both partes.

                     <p>Gardener, the great god of the Papiſts of Englande, ſayth, that it crept in by ſuperſticion of the lay ſorte.

His wordes be theſe, in his dialoge intituled (Tryphon.) <hi>Putatis ne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam inſtauranda Hieroſolyma, atque ibi colligendum veſtrum popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, in hilaritate victuru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cum Chriſto &amp; patriarchis &amp; prophaetis. &amp;c.</hi> That is. Do you thinke, that Hieruſalem ſhalbe reſtored again, &amp; that your people ſhalbe gathered thither, and ſhal liue with Chriſt, with the Patriarches and Prophets in mirth and pleaſure? He anſwereth.

                     <p>Eſay ſaith: I wil create new heauens, and a new earth,<note place="margin">Cap. 65.</note> and the former ſhal not be remembred, nor come into minde. But be you glad, &amp; reioyce for euer, in the thinges that I ſhall create. For behold, I wyll create Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eruſalem, as a reioyſing, and her people as a ioy. And I wil reioyce in Hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eruſalem, and ioy in my people, and the voice of weeping ſhalbe no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. Ther ſhalbe no more, ther a childe of yeres, nor an old man that hath not filled his dayes. For he that ſhal be an hundred yeares old, ſhall die as a young man, but the ſinner being an hundred yeres old, ſhalbe accurſed. And they ſhall build houſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite them, and they ſhall plant vineyards, and eate the fruite of them. They ſhall not build, and an other inhabite: they ſhal not plant, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eate: For as the daies of the tree are, ſo the daies of my people, and mine elect ſhall enioy in old age the worke of their hands. They ſhal not labour in vaine, nor bring forth in feare, for they are the ſede of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed of the Lord, and their buds with them. Yea, befor they call, I wil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and whileſt they ſpeake, I wyll heare.

For a certain man among vs, whoſe name was Ihon, one of Chriſtes Apoſtles, prophecied in a certain reuelation ſhewed vnto him, that as many which beleued in Chriſt, ſhould dwell in Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem a thouſand yeares, and after ſhal follow the vniuerſall and eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal reſurrection and generall iudgement, which alſo our Lord doth ſay: <hi>Non ducent vxores. &amp;c.</hi> They ſhall not marry wyues, nor geue any to marriage, but ſhalbe like vnto angels, ſeing they are the ſonnes of God, and of the reſurrection Theſe be Iuſtinus words.</p>
                     <p>To this point alſo ſemeth that to appeare, which Ireneus ſaith, that al people ſhal receiue a worthy habitacion before the iudgement. Nor that is much diſcrepant from this which Clement dreameth in his Egloges, wythout teſtimonye of the holye ſcriptures, that is, that men ſhall be chaunged into Angels, which ſhall firſt learne of other Aungels for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares, and ſhall after teache other men which are newly chaunged into Angels, which at the laſt (the time being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed) ſhalbe made Archangels.</p>

                     <p>And if this darknes had happened throughout the whole world, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome latin or Greke writer would haue made mencion therof.</p>
                     <p>Laurentius derideth that epiſtle which is written in Dionyſius name vpon this matter, and in my iudgement, the Chriſtians at that time had not ſo many ceremonies, as that epiſtle writeth. Furthermore, it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel (if he were ſo auncient an authour, and wrote ſo many thinges) that he was alledged of none of the old latine and Greke authours, neyther of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7195:226"/> Origene, Chriſoſtome, nor yet of Hierom, that left nothing vnaſſaid.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Gregory himſelfe being a man of approued faith, when he dyd make mencion of Dioniſius his letters, he declared not that he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Areopagita. Again, foraſmuch as great me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion is made in the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical hiſtory of the bookes of Dioniſius Biſhop of Corinth, it is not probable that Euſebius would haue talked nothing of him being ſo great &amp; worthy a ſcholar of ſaint Paules, if he had writ ſo many volumes.</p>
                     <p>Hierom reciteth one or two Dionyſius, he maketh no mencion of this Dionyſius his bookes.<note place="margin">In Catalo. ſcriptorum il<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>luſtrium.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laurentius declareth, that ther wer very wel learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his time, that iudged thoſe bookes to be made of Apollinarius.

                     <p>Not many yeres hence (as I remember) Vvilliam Grocinus a man of incomparable learning, as he was a great diuine, ſo in all kinde of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he was exactly learned and exerciſed, when he began to expounde the booke of celeſtiall Hierarchie in Paules church, ſtiflye affirmed in his preface, that Dionyſius Areopagita made that woorke, greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighing againſt the impudencye of them that agreed not to the ſame.

                     <p>I maruel greatly why Bede thinketh that this Dionyſius was made biſhop of Corinth, ſeing that the eccleſiaſtical hiſtory plainly declareth, that it was an other Dionyſius, biſhop of Corinth, which wrote manye workes. His authority is ther alledged, which in a certain Epiſtle that he wrote to the Athenians, ſhewed, that Dionyſius Areopagita was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted of Paul, and was made the firſt biſhop of Athens being ordred by the ſayd Apoſtle.

                     <p>For when the army of the Romanes hauing vanquiſhed the countrey of Azazen, had taken priſoners aboue ſeuen thouſand Perſians, &amp; wold in no wiſe reſtore them to their countrye (when they were famiſhed to death by litle and litle, &amp; the king hearing of it was not a litle greued.)
<pb facs="tcp:7195:227"/> This Acacius when he knew the matter, iudged, that it ought not ſo to be left of, but gathering together the Clergie that was vnder his iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, ſaid vnto them: Our God (O my ſonnes) nedeth no diſhes, neither careth for pots, for he nedeth neither to eate nor to drinke.

Vvherfore if they be married, they ought to refraine and temper them ſelues as other people do, &amp; as the Apoſtle doth here cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel in publick faſtings &amp; praiers, but in al other vſuall affaires &amp; buſines, they ar not forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vſe matrimony: for otherwiſe they ought alwaies to faſt alſo. For Paul willeth them to abſtain for a time, and to geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to faſting &amp; praier. Then if they do infer by this place, a Prieſt is bound alwaies to pray, and therfore to abſtain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> matrimony, they muſt be bound alſo to faſt continually, for ſaint Paul doth couple &amp; ioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both together.

                           <p>Thoſe courſes and turnes were ordeined for the prieſts, of Dauid, of Salomon, of Ioſias, &amp; other. But <hi>I</hi> pray you, what did they, &amp; how dyd they before Dauids time, &amp; before the courſes wer inſtituted &amp; made. Truly we rede in Exodus, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was the office &amp; duty of the high prieſt to offer ſacrifice daily both morning &amp; euening, &amp; alwaies to miniſter in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the courſes which wer afterward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitute, thei did not more reſpect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> act of matrimony, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt &amp; eaſe to be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſts.

<pb facs="tcp:7195:229"/> wer not ſufficient to proue, that mariage did pollute the prieſts. For wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting vpon Leuiticus, he diſputeth and reaſoneth purpoſely, how the high prieſt was able to offer dayly ſacrifice, both in the morning, &amp; at night.</p>
                           <p>If (ſaith he) any wil contend, that ſicknes &amp; diſeaſes might ſomtimes let him, it may be anſwered, that God by a ſingular priuilege and fauor might preſerue him, that he ſhould not be ſicke. But concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creation of children, what is to be ſaid: for when he was made vncleane by the reaſon of copulation, he could not come to the holy things. On the other ſide, it is hard to ſay, that he abſtained from the companye of hys wife, for the Prieſts both had wiues, and alſo begat childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Or els, ſaith Auſtine, the ſacrifice might be ſomtime intermitted and left vndone: but the ſcripture doth not ſeme to ſuffer that, for it was an expres commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement to be done dayly: or els (ſaith he) the prieſt might haue attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him a certain peculiar holines &amp; a certain prerogatiue aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, that the act of matrimony ſhould not defile him at any time.</p>
                           <p>But in his booke of retractations he bringeth in an other ſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The law (ſaith he) doth commaund, that a man after copulacion ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cleane vntil the euening, and that than he ſhould waſh his clothes, &amp; ſo be cleane, wher he had bene vncleane all the day before.</p>
                           <p>The high prieſt therfore might, when he had offred his ſacrifice in the morninge haue companie with his wife for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> procreation of children, &amp; ſo to remaine vncleane vntil the euening, and then to waſhe his clothes, &amp; ſo to purify him ſelf, and to be made cleane, &amp; ſo to offer the euening ſacrifice. Here you ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaint Auſtine did not flee for a ſolution vnto the <hi>24.</hi> courſes, for they were not for euer before Dauids time, yet he doth conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with Ambroſe, that the act of matrimony doth contaminate the huſbandes: but how truly, let the ſcriptures try and iudge.</p>
                           <p>In ſaint Ambroſe time ther wer (as he himſelf ſaith) a very few mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and they did miniſter dayly. But in theſe daies, ſeing ther is ſuche a number of prieſts, and a great company, which ſcarcely do miniſter the ſacrament twiſe or thriſe in the yeare, and do neuer baptiſe, why ſhulde they by this rule of Ambroſe be forbidden to marry, foraſmuch as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny of them do burne, and liue in whoordome?</p>
                           <p>Epiphanius writing <hi>Contra Valeſios hereticos,</hi> doth grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that ther was a certain Canon and tradition of the ſingle life of prieſtes, but (as he ſaith) this Canon was not obſerued in his time. For manye beinge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the miniſtery, were maried, and had children: and yet Epiphanius dyd not condemne them, nor iudgeth them to be depoſed, but that was (ſaith he) bicauſe diſcipline was then cold, and he doth excuſe it by the reaſon of the multitude of the faithfull, and by the fewnes of the Miniſters. But thoſe prieſts did dayly miniſter, and yet liued in matrimony.</p>

It is not credible that Abimelech dem anded this of harlots and ſtrompets, for ſuch were not ſuffred to liue in Iſrael. Therfore he meant of the acte of matrimonie, And by this it appeareth, and ought to be graunted, that (foraſmuch as they of the olde law could not be ſuffred to eate the ſhew bread whiche was but a figure, if they had the vſe of matrimonie) the Prieſtes of the newe law ought much more to abſtaine from mariage, becauſe they do receiue and miniſter the miſticall bread, which is the veritie.</p>

                        <p>The Prieſt aſked chiefly of women before all other thinges, becauſe that men mought ſoone be counted and made vncleane by their companie diuerſe and ſondry wayes, accordyng to the preſcription of the law, for the law pronounced not onely the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing her monethly diſeaſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, but alſo all them whiche touched her, her clothes, bead, her ſeat or any thing of hers.

Therfore Dauid ſayd, we came in no companie of women, nor touched any thyng of theirs beyng vncleane, for we haue bene ſeparate from them theſe three dayes, we chaunged our garmentes when we came forth, and the veſselles of the children be cleane, that is the veſselles in the whiche the bread is to be caried.

                        <p>To our purpoſe agayne. Let vs graunt, that Abimelech and Dauid meant wiues and the acte of matrimonie, and that there was therin ſome contamination by the law (which notwithſtanding cannot be proued by the Scriptures) will you therfore ſay, that it was ſinne? no verely you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, nor ought ſo to ſay, well than if it be no ſinne, why than ſhould that action reſtrain any man from miniſtration of holy things? The menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fluxe did make the woman vncleane. But I pray you who wilbe ſo fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to ſay, that affection or paſsion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body to be ſinne? To touch a dead corſe in the lawe was counted vncleane, ſhall we therfore ſay that they ſinned which buried bodies being dead? No man wilbe ſo fonde to ſay ſo. By what meanes than will you ſay, that the lawfull coniunction of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife ought to remoue them from the miniſterie, ſpecially if it be done for the cauſe of procreation, it is without ſinne (ſaith S. Auſten) yea and without ſinne alſo ſay I, if it be done for this cauſe, to auoyde for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh by the mouth of Paul ſaying. Let euery man haue his wife to auoyde fornication. To conclude therfore if it be not ſinne, it cannot impaire, let or hinder the holy miniſterie. I do not ſpeake this for that I do condemne or improue thoſe maried miniſters, or other whiche will temper them ſelues and refraine ſometimes from the acte of matrimonie, ſpecially when they ſhall eyther miniſter or receyue the Sacramentes.</p>
                        <p>To end, I do not a litle maruell to here, that ſome reaſon after this ſort. It is good for maried perſons to abſtaine for a few dayes, to geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to prayer and faſting, therfore it is much better ſo to do for many dayes: But it is beſt of al if they do it continually. <hi>I</hi> will make the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This man can beare <hi>.10</hi> pounds, therfore he can beare <hi>.20.</hi> pounds: if he can beare twenty poundes he can beare fo rtye poundes, and ſo foorth. O double foolerie, there is a regard to be had of mans infirmitie.</p>
                        <p>A man may temper and refraine for a tyme, but to do it perpetually were intollerable.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>VVhat <hi>Fides,</hi> is and how many ſignifications it hath, I haue ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared before. Notwithſtandyng I will ſhortly touche what it doth ſignifie in this place.</p>
                           <p>Our aduerſaries do ſay, that <hi>Fides,</hi> here doth betoken the vow of ſingle life: but I ſay with the aſſent of great learned men, that <hi>Fides,</hi> may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in this place a certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion and couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t made with the Church, when ſhe receiued widowes. For it is moſt euident, that the ſtate of matri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monie could not agre with that ſtate vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche widowes came, that is, that they ſhould ſerue the Churche, and ſhould liue all together in one companie: but a woman that is maried is ſubiect to her huſband, and is bound of neceſsitie to obey him.</p>
                           <p>The widowes of whom Paul ſpeaketh, were bounde in their miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to obey the Churche, in takinge care and ouer ſight of the weake, the ſicke, the diſeaſed, and in infourmyng of rude maydens and other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, vnto whom the miniſters of the Churche had no frequent nor iuſt acceſſe or repayre.</p>
                           <p>This was the chiefest and ſpeciall ministerie of the widowes in the Church. And doubtles they which were ſo admitted, and had made ſuch
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7195:231"/> compact with the Church, ought to abſtayne from mariage ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as they occupied that place and rowme. And although they promiſed vnto the Church to liue purely and chaſtly, yet they bounde them ſelues with no vowe, for all men are bound by the law of God to liue purely and chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſtate and condition to the whiche they be called. The ſouldiours when they are bound by couenaunt to do ſeruice, as long as they be in the warres, are not properly ſayd to make any vow, but they geue their faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full promiſe vnto the prince or Captaine to do their ſeruice truly. Euen ſo ſuch was the faith and promiſe of the widowes which they made vnto the Churche, that is, as long as they wayted on the Churche, and were found by the Church, to liue ſingly, purely and chaſtly, and after this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation it may be eaſly vnderstand what Paul would haue to be vnderſtand concerning widowes.</p>
                           <p>VVhen yonger widowes were receiued of the Church in many places to be found and nouriſhed after the ſort whiche <hi>I</hi> haue ſaid, they geuing them ſelues to idlenes, to exceſsiue fare and other pleaſures &amp; luſtes (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in yong &amp; tender age,) were intiſed &amp; ſtirred to fleſhly deſires and concupiſcences, and ſo to liue incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly (as the Apoſtle ſaith) they become wanton againſt Chriſt, that is, they liued impurely in ſcortation and whoredome.</p>
                           <p>And Hierom writi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <hi>Ad Geruntia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> doth ſo interpret this word <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, <hi>Laſciuiebam deuoratis cibis,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured meat vp to the gorge, I began to waxe wanton. To this alludeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commune prouerbe. <hi>Saturo venꝰ adeſt, famelico nequaquam adeſt,</hi> as the common ſaying in Terence is. <hi>Sine Cerere &amp; Baccho friget venus</hi> Nowe theſe widowes being taken &amp; eſpied in ſcortation, would marie, &amp; ſaid, that they would reuolte from the miniſterie: but to marrie was not of it ſelfe damnable, for who ſhould forbid them to marry when they would. But they had damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not becauſe they would marry, but becauſe they brake their faith, couenaunt and promiſe whiche they made before vnto the Churche: by the which they promiſed, that they would liue chaſtely, which they perfourmed not, but fell to wantones and whoredome, which thing made them da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable before God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore Paul ſaith plainly, that they had iudgement or damnation, becauſe that by ſcortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and whoredome, they made voide the promiſe geuen to the Church. Ouer &amp; beſide, they added to this, another miſchief, that is when they wer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this wantones, &amp; could not abide the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumely which the churche laide to their chardge, they maried heathen and infidels, and ſo were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate from Christ. Therfore, that no ſuch offendicles ſhould chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the Church, Paul ordeined, that no widowe ſhould be choſen vnder the
<pb facs="tcp:7195:232"/> age of .lx. yeares, as one that was not like to be ſubiect to this kind of wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton life: for commonly (although it be not generally,) the flames of fleſhe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is in ſuch age extinguiſhed. They will marrie (ſaith Paul) whiche they would not haue done, if they had not ben taken and eſpied in ſcortation, for that kinde of life pleaſed them better in the which they might liue at libertie and in wantones and pleaſure, being founde of the Churche, whiche was againſt Chriſt, for that the Goſpell of Chriſt was ill reported of by the heathen, who ſawe and harde of ſuch filthines to be among them, whiche ſhould liue purely and honeſtly.</p>
                           <p>Our aduerſaries therfore cannot gather of this place, that theſe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes had damnation for that they would marrye, but becauſe they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued wickedly, and than did pretende mariage when they were taken, whiche otherwiſe they would neuer haue attempted: And thus may the aduerſarie ſee, that Paul meaneth not here of any vowe, but a certayne paction and couenaunt made with the Churche to liue ſingle, as long as they ſhould continewe in that ſtate and function. VVe haue here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland almoſt the like example. In the Collegies of the vniuerſities ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that be felowes of the houſe, muſt liue ſingle and without wife, as long as they remaine felowes of the College. But yet they make no vowe not to marry, for they may marry if they will go out of the College.</p>

                           <p>The third ambiguitie and doubt is this worde condemnation. They that do fauour the vowe of ſingle life more than lawfull mariage, do iudge, that thoſe widowes ſhall entre into the iudgement of God, becauſe forſaking the vowe whiche they had begon to take in hande, they do pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe to marry, and that they do ſo greuouſly ſinne, that vnleſse they do repent and forſake their mariage whiche they had begon, they ſhalbe damned with the deuill for euer.</p>
                           <p>But other men ſeyng that matrimonie is an holy thing among all men, and that the knotte therof (by the witnes of Chriſt and his Apoſtles) is not to be broken, but for adultery or by the goyng awaye of either the huſband or the wife, will not attribut ſo much to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vow of widowes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, for that it is a thing inuented by man, which doth vnloſe mariage agaynſt the minde of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, becauſe the will of God is to be preferred before mans inuention.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore they thincke, that it is the Apostles commaundement, that they do marry which do not liue chaſte, and that it is better to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then to burne.</p>
                           <p>VVherupon although they graunt that thoſe widowes whiche were receyued at that tyme in the Churche, couenaunted (or as our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will, vowed ſingle lyfe and honeſt conuerſation) yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if they did marry, it followeth not that they were condemned.</p>
                           <p>For they ſay that this word <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, which Paul now vſeth, muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> widowes were cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of men vnconſtant, &amp; were reported of moſt men to be of an ill lightnes, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they altered their purpoſe which ſemed ſo holy.

It is moſt certaine, that Tertullian meant not virgins not conſecrated of Biſhops, for the virgines at Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, came into the Temple bare headed, but when this doyng was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and reproued of many by the woordes of Paule to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, the inhabitantes of Carthage aunſwered, that, that place of Paule was to be vnderſtand of maried women, and not of virgines. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian therfore writeth and proueth the woordes of Paule to pertayne to all women, aſwell the virgines as the maried women ought to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in the congregation: but after the tyme of Tertullian certaine vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines whiche had vowed in mynde perpetuall chaſtitie, were couered with an holy vayle. The maner was this: The Biſhop in the open aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of the Churche, receyued them not without certayne ceremonies. Theſe virgines remayned firſt in their parentes houſe, and neuer came abroade, excepte it were to offer Sacrifice or els to viſite the Christian brother beyng in priſon, or els to here ſome Sermon. Saint Hierome prayſed one Aſellam, becauſe ſhe was wonte to repayre to ſuch thynges, and doth aftentimes exhorte virgines, that they might more ſafely kepe their chaſtitie, to ſecke Martirs in their chambers.</p>
                              <p>After this by the labour and meanes of Marcella and Paula, Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and houſes for virgines were inſtitute and made at Rome. Theſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines did ſhere their heades, and did offer their ſhorne heares to their mother. The cauſe (ſayth Saint Hierome) why they were ſhorne, was, for to auoyde vermine and lyſe, whiche do brede in the heare and the ſkinne. And when they were ſhorne, the Biſhop couered their head and face with a vayle, leaſt they ſhould wantonly ſee or be ſeene, leaſt they ſhould loue, or beloued. This maner of couering of virgines was after the time both of Tertullian and of Cyprian.</p>

The ſaying of ſaint Auguſtine,<note place="margin">Cap. 34.</note> in his booke <hi>De bono coniugali,</hi> is not diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt from this hiſtory of Athanaſius. His wordes be theſe. <hi>Non eſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par continentiae meritum in Ioanne, qui nullas expertus eſt nuptias, et in Abrahamo, qui filios genuit: nam vt Ioannes in opere, ita Abraham in ſolo habitu continentiam colebat, melior eſt autem caſtitas caelibum qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nuptorum, quarum vnam Abraham habebat in vſu, ambas in habitu, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte enim &amp; coniugaliter vixit.</hi> That is. The merite of continencye is not vnequal in Iohn, which was not maried, and in Abraham whiche begat children. For as Iohn did embrace continency in worke, ſo Abraham did in habite onely. Better is the chaſtity of the ſingle perſons, then of the maried, wherof Abraham had the one in vſe, and the other in habit, for he liued co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iugally &amp; alſo chaſtly. Vve do not produce theſe teſtimonies to extenuate the gifts of God, among which we count the chaſte ſingle life to be one: but we ſay, that this kinde of life is not by it ſelf, and of his own nature, a chriſtian perfection. For faſting, ſingle life, &amp; virginity haue not hy their nature any ſtate of vertue in them ſelues, except they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7195:236"/> to ſome other good end and thing, which by it ſelfe, and for it ſelf is to be deſired &amp; practiſed, as to praiers, &amp; to holy ſtudies. To be plain, if great and equall perfection be found as wel in matrimony, as in ſingle life, muſt it not nedes follow, than that ther is no proper perfection, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to matrimony, nor to ſingle life? For if either of them were by hys own nature a perfection, it woulde increaſe and augment perfection in him in whom it is found, but it did not increaſe that perfection in Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which was a chaſte ſingle man, and declared by the oracle of God, to be equal to a married man.</p>
                              <p>Vvherfore it ful wel followeth, that ſingle life by his nature is no per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection, but as pertaining to faith, hope, and charity (which be the true meaſures of the Euangelical perfection) Anthony and the Couriar wer both equal and like. Vvherupon it may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, that ſingle life made not Anthony more acceptable or woorthy vnto God. For if it did, then we might make this argument which the Logicians cal, <hi>Argumentum a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iugatis, Caelibatus natura ſua eſt perfectio, ergo iſte caelebs eſt perfectꝰ.</hi> I cannot ſay whither you wil graunt the conſequent, or no. If this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not good, then ſingle life is by it ſelfe no perfection.</p>

                              <p>Here we do demaund, whither ye wil affirme, that Abraham had more faith, hope and charity, then Iohn the Baptiſt? And whether the Couriar, more then Anthony? If you affirme that Abraham had more, then Abraham muſt farre excel Iohn, and muſte haue more merite, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had more charitye, bicauſe the whole reaſon of merite (as both you and the ſcholemen do ſay) doth depend of charity. Now, if ye denye it, than alſo they be not like and equall. For then they haue faith, hope, and charity equal, but to one of them beſide thoſe vertues reherſed ther commeth virginitye, which (as you ſaye) is the Euangelicall perfection. Therfore they are vnequall, contrary to the teſtimony of Auguſtine, &amp; the hiſtory of Athanaſius.</p>
                              <p>To make the matter plain, the argument wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we pres you, is this. Either you attribut vnto Abraham, equal charity with that which Iohn had or els vnequall. If ye attribute equall, than Iohn is more perfecter then Abraham, bycauſe biſide charitye, he had alſo virginity, which you cal euangelical perfection. But if Abraham had more charity then Iohn,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:237"/> then he had alſo more merite then Iohn. For merite (as you ſaye) depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not of virginity, but of charity. But ſaint Auguſtine writeth, that matrimony in Abraham, and continency in Iohn, be of like and equal me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite. It could not be of equal merite, vnles equal chariti wer of both parts</p>
                              <p>Neither virginity hath by it ſelfe, of her own nature, &amp; in it ſelfe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faculty or vertue to make a man more acceptable vnto God, but that it hath onely of that which is ioyned vnto it, that is, of faith and charity, and the ſelfe ſame thing is to be graunted in matrimony. But if you wyll make Abraham wors then Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces the gray friar, it is an other matter. That wer in my iudgement a great abſurdity. And where you contende that the condicion and ſtate of virginity &amp; ſingle life is to be preferred before matrimony, we wil graunt you, but not in ſuch behalf, that it is an Euangelical perfection. But bicauſe it is a more expedite and eaſy way, to ſpread abrod, and to promulgate the kingdome of heauen, that is, the word of God. And this is true concerning certaine perſons, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Thus I truſt, our aduerſaries be anſwered for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of prieſtes at the full, if they will (at the leaſt) be aunſwered.</p>

                     <p>In the .xv.

                     <p>In the .xxi. Seſsion, Anno <hi>.1416.</hi> the .xxx. of May, Hierom of Praga was condemned, which was Huſſeis companion.</p>

                     <p>In the .xxix. Seſsion it was decreed, that after euery fift yeare, than after ſeuen yeres, and laſt of al from tenne yeares to tenne yeres a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councel ſhould be kept.</p>

                     <p>This councell of Conſtaunce hath two contraries.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it was decreed ther, that the councel is aboue the Pope, which thing is moſt true, for Hierome writeth to Euagrius thus: <hi>Si autoritas quaeritur, maior eſt orbis vrbe. &amp;c.</hi> That is. If authority be required, the world is greater then a Citye: ſo the whole Churche is greater then one church of Rome, and the church of Rome is not aboue the whole vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall church: but contrariwiſe the whole church and the councell, which repreſenteth the church, is aboue the church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it condemned this article of Iohn Huſſey. The Pope is not by the law of God aboue all churches. And this determination playnlye
<pb facs="tcp:7195:238"/> gaine ſaith the firſt. In this ſeconde determination agaynſt Huſſe, the whole church of the Eaſt &amp; of Africa was gaynſaid, &amp; it is alſo againſt the councels of Nice and of Africa.</p>
                     <p>Bicauſe mencion is made here of Pope Iohn the .xxiii. depoſed by this councel, I ſhall thinke it not impertinent to this part, to deſcrihe and ſet forth vnto you the whole life of the ſaid Pope Iohn.</p>
                     <p>This Iohn was a Frenchman, named before Iacobus Catucenſis. He was a Cardinal, &amp; biſhop of Portua. And after two yeres, in the which the ſea was vacant, by the alterations of <hi>.22.</hi> Cardinals, he was denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Pope at Lyons. He was ſo much deſirous of new thinges, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided ſingle biſhoprickes into two. And after they were deuided, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted them again to one, &amp; he tranſlated Monaſteries alſo into biſhop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rickes, and likewiſe biſhopricks into Monaſteries. He ordeined that thriſe in the day the Aue bels ſhould be knoled, that the people kneling, might idolatrouſly ſay the ſalutacion of the aungell to the virgin Mary. He called them obſtinate heretickes, which would affirme, that Chriſt and the Apoſtles had nothing proper to them ſelues, and he ſent buls to the vniuerſities, that the ſcholemen durſt not diſpute of that thing. He taught certain errours, and chiefly, that the ſoules after they be dead, do not ſee God before the latter day.</p>

Therfore one Peter of Cabaria, a minorite Friar, was created Pope of Rome, and was called Nicholas the fift.

For when he was long time ſuſpected of hereſy vnto Theophilus Biſhop of Alexandria to be in the Anthropomorphites errour, yet when Theophilus had knowen that Epiphanius iudged a right of God, he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured him againe, and broughte to paſſe, that Epiphanius mighte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Origens bokes in the Synode gathered in Cyprus. In which thing Epiphanius followed Theophilus his mynde, and wrote alſo to Iohn the biſhop of Conſtantinople, to gather a Synode, and that he alſo would con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demne Origens bookes. But Iohn delayed the matter. Vvherupon Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius came a lytle after to Conſtantinople, whom Iohn with all the Clergie came forth to mete, and that he might gratifye Theophilus, he brought with him the condemnation of Origens bookes, and openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the variaunce which he had with Iohn: yet notwithſtanding he did not preuaile with all men to ſubſcribe to the condemnacion of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens bookes.

                     <p>Epiphanius than tooke vpon him a bold and licentious enterpriſe in the church of Conſtantinople, that he might pleaſure Theophilus, who was great enemy to Iohn, in that he ordered a Deacon, contrarye to the Canons, and alſo that with ſharpe checkes he taunted Iohn the Byſhop openly in hys Sermon.</p>

                     <p>Epiphanius diſdaining the matter, purpoſed to returne into Cyprus, either bicauſe it repented him that he came into Conſtantinople, or els bicauſe he was admoniſhed and perſwaded therunto of God, as Sozome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus reherſeth, who alſo addeth this, that Epiphanius entring into the ſhip, ſayd vnto them that had followed him vnto the ſea: I leaue vnto you this city, this court, and this hipocriſy, but I go hence ſpedely.</p>
                     <p>Socrates wrote, that he hearde ſome menne ſaye, that Epiphanius, (when he went from Conſtantinople) ſayd thus vnto Iohn the Byſhop, I hope that thou ſhalt not dye a Byſhoppe.

                     <p>Two beggers waiting in the high way for Epiphanius (when he went vpon a time from home) that they might get the larger almes of him, the one of them proſtrating him ſelf on the ground, did lye as though he had bene dead, and the other ſtanding by him, wept, as though he had lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his fellowes death, and complayned vnto Epiphanius of his pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, bicauſe he was not able to bury the dead man lyeng on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; to bring him to his graue, for lacke of money. And Epiphanius ſaide, let him lye in reſt and peace. And geuing the other man things neceſſary for the burial, ſaid vnto him: ſee vnto the buriall my ſonne, and ceaſe from weping, for he ſhal not riſe againe at this preſent. That which hath now happened cannot be reuoked and vndone, and it ought to be taken paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. Vvhen he had ſpoken theſe words, he went onward. Afterwarde when none appeared in ſight, the begger that ſtoode by hym, ſpurnyng him lying on the ground, and alſo prayſing him that he counterfeited ſo wel a dead man ſaid vnto him: aryſe, that we may paſſe away this daye merily. But when he neuertheles lay ſtyll on the ground, and heard not the other man crying &amp; ſpeaking aloud vnto him, neither felt him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beat him with his feete with al his might, this other man comming ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtely vnto the biſhop, told him what crafty practiſe they had vſed, and weping and pulling his heare, prayeth him to raiſe his fellow again. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius exhorted the man not to take greuouſly that which had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſayd: let him go, for God wyll not vndoo that he hadde done. Vvherby he doth ſignify vnto all men, that they whych ſo behaue them ſelues towards Gods Miniſters, go about to diſceaue God, who heareth and ſeeth all thinges.</p>

                     <p>Yea theſe olde Sacramentes were to be permitted to them for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and chiefly to them, whiche came of that people to whom they were geuen, but afterwarde they ought to haue bene forſaken and left of all Chriſtians, as though they had ben reuerently buried and hidden.</p>
                     <p>By this learned ſentence of Auguſtine we know, that the ceremonies of the Iewes, were not immediatly after Christes Paſsion pernitious and hurtfull, for they ſinned not whiche obſerued them for a tyme, although there was no hope of ſaluation to be put in them.

                        <p>They do graunt, that Paul diſsembled in theſe Iudaicall obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when he knewe that they were nothyng worth, but at ſuch tyme as he myght not hurte by his example, but myght profit by his diſsembling. VVhen he came to Lystra, he circumciſed Timothie whom he would haue to be his iourney felowe, fearyng leaſt he ſhould hynder the fayth of the Iewes, by whom he ſhould paſſe, if he ſhould lead aboute with him an vncircumciſed man, furthermore he did appeaſe tumultes and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whiche might be moued agaynſt him. Alſo be circumciſed Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, becauſe he would ſend hym to teache the Iewes, and he did ſo, that the teacher myght be the more accepted of his auditours, yet for that end (as Chriſoſtome ſaith) he circumciſed Timothie that he might abrogate circumciſion. And if the Iewes had knowen that Timothie had not bene circumciſed, they would not at all haue hard Timothie preach.</p>
                        <p>Neither Paul did offende, when at Hieruſalem, he feyned the Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call purifications, for they profited and ſaued charitie, neyther did they hurte or hinder the fayth of Christ beyng receyued, therfore he was not to be reproued in theſe ſimulations. But Peters diſsimulation was euill, becauſe it dyd hurte and offende the Gentiles, that were lately called to the fayth.</p>

                        </gap>ration, and a phraſe of the Hebrue tounge. The Prophet in dede here ſemeth at the firſt ſight to leaue men perplexe and doubtfull, but in the next verſe he offred them grace &amp; fauour, if they would repent from the bottom of their hartes. Wherfore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet ſemeth not to proſequute his talk, but rather to be diuerſe: And al exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with the which God exhorteth vs to repentance, are cold, yea rather friuolous except he teſtifie him ſelfe to be ready &amp; willing to reconciliation. Wheras ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet here doth leaue the mindes of men in ſuſpenſe, he ſemeth to cut of that whiche he before entreated of the mercie of God. But this maner of ſpech is to be obſerued whiche oftentimes is founde in the Scriptures. For as ofte as God is deſcribed vnto vs, hard to forgeue ſinne, this pertaineth to the ſturring vp of our ſlouth, and to ſhake of our negligence. At the firſt we are colde, when God doth inuite vs, except he pricke vs forward by ſondrie wayes. And alſo, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come vnto him, we do it remiſſely and ſlenderlie. Wherfore it is neceſſarie, that both theſe faultes be corrected in vs, that is, that our ſlomberyng be quickned and ſturred, and that theſe delightes be driuen awaye with the whiche we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much flatter our ſelues: And to this end is the counſell of the Prophet, for he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth vnto deſperate perſons. If he onely had ſayd, God is ready to forgeue, If he had vſed onely this forme of ſpech, perhaps they would haue come negligently, &amp;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7195:243"/> would not earneſtly haue bene touched with the feare of God. Therfore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth as it wer conſult with them. Although we may worthely diſpayre (for we be vnworthy, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God at any tyme ſhould receyue vnto hym) yet there is no cauſe why we ſhould be vtterly diſmayed. <hi>Quis enim ſcit. &amp;c,</hi> that is, God is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. Wherfore we ought not diſpeir, for the Prophete doth propone vnto vs a difficultie of obteyning gods fauour, not that he might leaue men in a doubte (for that were contrarie to his former doctrine) but that he might geue ſome taſt of the mercie of god, that they ſhould gather theyr ſpirites vnto them by litle and litle, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould not perſuade them ſelues to be in ſecuritie, but that they ſhould come vnto god carefully, and with much deliberation, after that they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered their offences.</p>

His wordes be theſe. <hi>Hoc ſic dixit non ambigens (val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de enim perſuaſum erat Prophetae, ſed volens illum terrere &amp; cogere vt hoc faciat. &amp;c.)</hi> He ſaid, this not doubting (for it was thoroughly perſuaded vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet) but mindyng to put him in fear, &amp; to conſtrain him to do this. For if he had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirmatiuely, the king would haue ben the more negligent. So likewiſe we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most of al do inſtigate and make him the more earneſt, when we ſay, deſire him &amp; ſhewe vnto him, perchaunce, he wil heare thee: for feare riſing of a doubt doth pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoke a man the more, for this cauſe the prophete made it not ſure and certayne. What ſayeſt thou? wil god forgeue ſo great wickednes? There is no ſinne which almeſdede cannot purge and extinguiſhe. Euery ſinne geueth place vnto almes, and is a remedie profitable for euery wounde.</p>
                     <p>This and ſuch like places of ſcripture are not to be vnderſtand as though the worck it ſelfe of almes geuing, doth iuſtifie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but that if it be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith and godly loue, it doth declare and teſtifie man to be iuſtified. The like place we haue in the Euangeliſt ſ. Luke, where Chriſt ſpeaketh to the phariſies after this ſort: <hi>Date cleemoſynam, &amp; ecce omnia mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vobis.</hi> Geue almes, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hold all things are cleane vnto you. That the papiſtes out of this place do inferre almes deedes to bee a ſatiſfaction, by the whiche wee are made cleane from our ſinnes, it is more vayne then that it nedeth any long refutation. Neither Chriſt doth here diſpute by what price, we may attayne the remiſſion of our ſinnes, but that they do eate their bread vndefiledly whiche geue parte vnto the poore. The conſcience is not purged, but by repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth conſiſte chiefly in two pointes, the one in the acknowledging of our faultes, the other in a ſure faith, that through Chriſt our ſinnes are remitted. Wherfore, when Chriſt admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the phariſies to purge their conſciences from ſinne, by the ſame wordes he willed them to acknowledge their ſinne, and to beleue that through Chriſt they were forgeuen, for he onely can reconcile vs vnto god, and make ſatiſfaction for our wickednes. Alſo he addeth the fruietes of repentaunce, that is the worckes of charitie whiche procede of faith.</p>
                     <p>As for the wordes of Peter out of the actes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles whiche he ſpake vnto Simon Magus, ſaying, Repent from thy wickednes, and pray,<note place="margin">Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus. 6.</note> if perchaunce god will forgeue thee.

<pb facs="tcp:7195:244"/> for a man to perſuade him ſelfe any certayntie in his prayers. But if the wordes of ſaint Peter be wel vewed, the anſwere is ſone made, for this greke word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, is asmuch to ſay, as if a man ſhould ſay in Latin. <hi>Si qua tibi remittat deus.</hi> If god by any means may forgeue thee. This maner of ſpech Peter vſeth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of Simon in doubt, but that he might y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more prouoke him to erneſt prayer, for the difficultie of the matter is of no ſmall force to excite and ſturre vs: becauſe when we ſe that the matter is more eaſie, and in our own power, we are to ſecure and ſluggiſh. Wherfore Peter doth not here put Simon in a terror and feare, to the intent that he might put all confidence and hope out of his mind and ſo diſcourage him, but declaring that there was a certayne hope leaft vnto him, if he called for mercie with an humble and lowly ſpirite (onely to make hym the more ardent,) ſheweth him, that for the greuouſnes of his ſins, it was hard to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne pardon: for faith is moſt neceſſarie when ſoeuer we haue acceſſe vnto god, and pray vnto him, yea rather it is the mother of prayer.</p>

                     <hi>In primis</hi> no ſchiſme ought to be made for diuerſitie of doctrine.

Therfore ſeyng the doctrine of the Miniſters in the Churche expoundeth thoſe thynges whiche are of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the true and ſincere fayth, what more haue thoſe ſchiſmatikes to require.

In expoundyng hath bene alwayes a

                     <p>Origen iudged, that euery thing in the ſcripture might aptly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by an Allegorye and Anagogicallye, and hee brought into the ſcholes and churches a marueilous boldnes, for other men ſo to doo He writeth moſt plainly of this in his commentaries, whom certayne other Greke writers did imitate and follow.</p>

                     <p>In the ſpirituall contemplation, we paſſe ouer to higher thynges, we leaue earthlye thynges, and we diſpute of the bleſſedneſſe of thynges to

As for example, Chriſt prohibiting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce of the wife, vnleſſe it be for fornication, ſheweth prudentlye the cauſe, why the libell of diuorce was before permitted to the Iewes.

                     <p>The fourth is (ſayth he) <hi>ſecundum allegoriam,</hi> when it is taught, that thoſe thinges which are written, are not to bee taken according to the letter, but are figuratiuely to be vnderſtand (as for example) Saynt Paule declareth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> that the hiſtory of Exodus was an allegorie of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, and that all thynges happened to the Fathers in a figure.</p>
                     <p>Hereby it came to paſſe, that ſome men haue taken in hande whole hiſtories, yea whole bookes to be expounded after theſe diuers wayes.</p>
                     <p>Ruffinus, (as witneſſeth Genadius) expounded the benediction of Iacob vpon the Patriarches, in three maner of ſenſes, that is, hiſtoricall, moral, and miſticall.</p>
                     <p>But after that time, boldnes to expound the ſcriptures diuerſe waies grew more and more. For ſome men ſhameleſly attempted to interpret by allegories and anagogies what thing ſo euer is written in the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures: and not onely the hiſtories (in which it is often times done wyth a grace) but alſo the preachings and diſputations of the Prophetes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the preceptes alſo and promiſes, in the which there can be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion (without perill) from the ſimple grammatical ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>But now I wyll ſhew, what ought to be iudged of theſe diuers formes of interpretations, and wyl alſo declare, how the ſayinges of the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are to be vnderſtand. I wyl intreate orderly of euery one, and firſt of the litterall ſenſe, next of the tropologicall, then of anagogicall, and laſt of the allegorical.</p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:7195:251"/>
                     <p>The literal ſenſe (which otherwiſe is called hiſtorical or Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>matical) ought firſt to be ſought out as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt nobleſt &amp; chefeſt ſenſe, foraſmuch as it alone bringeth forth perſpicuous &amp; euident ſentences It is only apt to frame argumentes by which the doctrines of religion are confirmed, it alone geueth neceſſary probations, where out of the allegoricall and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogicall ſenſes onely probable and apparant aſſertions are brought.</p>
                     <p>It is not lawfull at any time to leaue the ſimple and natiue ſenſe of the wordes, vnleſſe there be figures in the wordes, or the ſentence it ſelf ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken grammaticallye, do ſignifie ſome abſurditie, for the which cauſe it is nedefull to flye to the allegoricall interpretation, wherof I wyll ſpeake hereafter.</p>

                        </gap>, ought vtterly to be referred to thys kynde: for in it there is no digreſſion made from the Grammaticall ſenſe, but onely the cauſe of the dede, or of the woorde being expounded, the ſentence is made more plaine and open.</p>
                     <p>For in all interpretation of euery kinde of writing, the ſame is moſt neceſſary to be done: for oftentimes it is expedient, that we ſet before our eyes the intent of the writer, and to be ſhewed as it were with pointing of the finger, to what end the oration tendeth, why it is ordayned, and how great weight euery part hath.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore the other kind of intepreting which Auguſtine calleth <hi>ſecundum</hi>

                        </gap>, can not be ſeparated from the Grammaticall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, for it is not like vnto an allegorie (as ſome do ſuppoſe.) For <hi>analogia,</hi> is none other thing than a certaine collation and conference, wherin what ſoeuer haue bene eyther done or ſayd in the old Teſtament, are compared with thoſe things that are found to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or done in the newe Teſtament. Of which ſort this is. If any man reaſoning of Iudas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying his Maiſter vnto his enemies with a kiſse, which is a ſimbole or ſigne of amitie and frendſhip, doth ſaye, that he did the ſame which once did Ioab, who killed Amaza, while he feyned to kiſſe him.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe if any man doth ſhewe, that the woordes of Chriſt or of the Apoſtle doe in all things agree with the wordes of Moyſes or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy Prophet or worthy man.</p>

                        <p>Tropologicall expoſition is not far from that ſenſe, which the wordes of the ſentence doo bring forth, but is an applying of that which is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the words, to the framing of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life &amp; maners.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7195:253"/> attayne to the miſticall ſenſe without the vnderſtandyng of the ſimple letter, They do leane to this authoritie ſaying. <hi>Litera occidit, ſpiritus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro viuificat,</hi> that is, the letter killeth, but the ſpirit quickneth, wheras no letter killeth, but that onely whiche is peruerſly vnderſtood and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wreſted, to that whiche is farre ſtraunge, from that whiche God the author meaneth. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. The phariſeis wreſted the good worckes whiche God commaunded in the old Teſtament, vnto vayne ceremonies. For when God had geuen the commaundementes of the law by Moſes, at the lenght he inferred this. <hi>Ligabis ea in manu tua,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>&amp; erunt immota an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te oculos tuos.</hi> that is. Thou ſhalt binde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thy handes, and they ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be alwayes ſet before thine eyes, of which wordes this is the meaning. Let my preceptes be in thine handes that they may be accompliſhed in your worckes. Let them be before thine eyes, that thou mayeſt remember the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day and night.</p>
                        <p>The phariſies miſunderſtanding this, wrote the tene commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the law in parchment, &amp; to the end they might alwayes haue them in ſight, they wrapte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp in a garland, and bound them vpon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heades Here the letter killed, becauſe the phariſies corrupted the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of God. But if the letter be well vnderſtood, there is meant an other thyng, And we ſhall perceyue a great congruencie betwene the miſticall worde and the letter of the law. VVhich thing I proue thus.</p>
                        <p>VVe read in the old law, that Pharaos magicall men, when Moſes &amp; Aaron wrought miracles before their faces, (God working by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) ſaid. <hi>Vere digitus dei eſt hic.</hi> Indede, this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fingar of god.<note place="margin">Exod. 8 Luk. 11.</note> we read alſo in the goſpel, that chriſt ſaid. <hi>Ego in digito dei eiicio demonia.</hi> that is, I caſt out deuils by the fingar of God. VVhat other thing can we vnderſtand in the olde and newe lawes here by the fingar of God, than the holy ghoſt and the power of God? as Saint Baſill interpreteth, beſide many other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fathers.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe as it is ſayd before, where Chriſt commaundeth,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to cut of and caſt away eye, hande and foote, if they offende vs.</p>
                        <p>Saint Hierome ſaith, that they be miſtically ſignified, which are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs in kindred, familiaritie and frendſhip, who all in reſpect of loue toward Chriſt, are to be reiected and contemned.</p>
                        <p>How could any miſterie here be gathered, excepte Chriſt had ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ſame in the better by a parable?</p>
                        <p>Origene gathered out of theſe wordes an higher myſterie, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the eye to be vnderſtande the Biſhop and Prieſt in the Churche, who ought to haue reſpect to ſaluation of all perſons, by the hand he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the deacon, becauſe he is a miniſter, by the foote the people.
<pb facs="tcp:7195:254"/> And all theſe ought to be caſt of, if they behaue not them ſelues rightly in matters of fayth.</p>
                        <p>For aſmuch then as the myſticall ſenſe is builded vpon the letter as vpon a foundation the letter is not to be reiected. Notwithſtanding there be infinite places in the holy Scriptures, which if they be drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſes, they do rather kill than edifie, as for example, this ſentence. <hi>Ecce virgo concipiet &amp; pariet filiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; vocabitur nomen eius Emanuel,</hi> that is, beholde, a virgine ſhall conceaue and bring forth a ſonne, and his name ſhalbe called Emanuell. Theſe wordes ought to be none otherwiſe vnderſtand, but as the letter ſpeaketh: yet Saint Hierome maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of one, who did interprete this place, myſtically ſaying, that the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine betokened the ſoule, beyng corrupt with no ſpotte of ſinne. This vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine bryngeth foorth Emanuel, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, the worde of God. This ſenſe is as fondly ſought out as it is farre fetched.</p>
                        <p>Let vs therfore take the literall ſenſe for the foundation, vpon whiche euery doctrine ought to be builte (whiche I ſpake by a ſimilitude) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse any wilbe ſo fooliſhe, as to thincke, that we ought to caſt awaye the rudiments and alphabeticall letters, that we may the ſooner come to the ſtudy and knowledge of Philoſophie.</p>

                        <p>Thus hauyng playnely and ſufficiently entreated of the literall and Tropologicall ſenſe, I will now ſpeake of the allegoricall.</p>
                        <p>The intreating of allegories pertayneth not to euery common ſorte of people, neither it muſt be handled raſhly and in euery place. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great diligence muſt be beſtowed in the declaration of them, I will orderly diſcuſſe the matter.</p>
                        <p>Firſt I wil ſhew what an allegory is. Secondly how it differeth from a type. Thirdly where and when it is conuenient to adde allegoricall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations. Fourthly whiche is the moſt apteſt waye to gather ſuch interpretations. Fiftly and finally I will declare what is the vſe of them, and how farre they are to be admitted.</p>
                        <p>An allegory generally is defined (as teſtifieth Auguſtine) to be a trope, where out of one thyng is vnderſtand an other thing,<note place="margin">De trinitate lib. 15. cap. 9. 1. Theſſ, ca. 5,</note> as in this example of Paul. <hi>Itaque non dormiamus ſicut &amp; caeteri, ſed vigilemus &amp; ſobrii ſi mus, nam, qui dormiunt, nocte dormiunt, &amp; qui inebriantur nocte ſunt ebrii, at nos qui ſumꝰ diei, ſobrii ſumus,</hi> that is. Therfore let vs not ſlepe as others do, but let vs wake and be ſober, for they which ſlepe, do ſlepe
<pb facs="tcp:7195:255"/> in the night, and they that are droncken, are droncken in the night, but we whiche be of the day, let vs be ſober.</p>
                        <p>This ſentence is to be taken allegoricall.</p>
                        <p>Hierome ſaith, that an allegory doth portend one thing in wordes, and ſignifieth another thing in ſenſe. The bookes of Oratours and Poetes are full. The holy Scripture alſo hath in it many allegories.</p>
                        <p>But after this ſorte an allegorie extendeth it ſelfe more largely, for as much as this definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be applied to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſons, ſimilitudes, darcke ſpeaches, apophthegmes, parables, apologos, and ironies.</p>
                        <p>Therfore it is requiſite to define an allegorie more ſtraytly, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Allegoria,</hi> is an interpretation of the Scriptures fetched ſomewhat farre of, and is adioyned either for vtilitie, or els for neceſsitie vnto the Grammaticall and morall interpretation. And although it be ſomewhat farre from the meaning of the wordes, yet it kepeth a mete ſimilitude of thoſe thinges whiche be compared together, and it is alwayes proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the doctrine of faith, and applied to the inſtruction of the hearers.</p>
                        <p>The eccleſiaſticall writers haue many exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of this interpretation.</p>
                        <p>VVe ſe the fabulouſe narrations of Poetes (which wer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuines of the heathen) to be ſo expounded, that vnder them may ſeme to be hidden the knowledge of great matters, and alſo that much doctrine may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of them, as of the natures of thinges, the framyng of life, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Religion. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Theſe formes and kindes of interpretation <hi>Palephatus,</hi> hath elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written of, and alſo <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> and Saint Baſile.</p>
                        <p>Euery one of thoſe interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s if we weigh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel, is plaine allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, and no man can deny, but there is in them great vtilitie &amp; profit.</p>
                        <p>After this ſorte therfore many places of the holy Scriptures are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded allegorically and with great fruite, ſpecially when it is manifeſt, that the holy Scripture, is fuller of miſteries than can be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that it geueth most plentifull matter of ſpirituall goodnes to the whole vſe of man, aſwell of life as of knowledge.</p>
                        <p>By this it may appeare, what is properly meant by an allegory.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe it is ſayd in the Prophet Hieremie. <hi>Bibite &amp; inebriamini, vomite &amp; cadite.</hi> Drincke and be droncken, ſpew and fall.</p>
                        <p>Here is taken a ſimilitude and maner of ſpeaking out of the manners of droncken men, and are noted incredible troubles and great ſlaughters to follow, of ſuch kyndes of ſentences, Saint Auguſtine geueth a rule ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: An allegory muſt be aduiſedly diſtinguiſhed from a type. For we ſe many men to confounde types &amp; allegories together, &amp; where there is a type in any writer, they falſly affirme it to be an allegory. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7195:255"/> VVhere Paul ſaith. <hi>Patres noſtros fuiſſe omnes ſub nube, &amp; omnes per mare tranſiſſe. &amp;c.</hi> That is, that all our fathers were vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cloude, and that they paſsed all through the ſea, and that they were all baptized in Moſes in the cloude and in the ſea. &amp;c. they ſuppoſe this to be an alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, but they are deceyued, for it is onely a type, or rather an example, for the Apoſtle proueth by euident examples, that thoſe men ſhould not eſcape vnpuniſhed, whiche after they had vſed the Sacramentes godly inſtituted by Chriſt, returned agayne to their former ſinnes.</p>
                        <p>I will therfore ſhew you a difference betwene a type and an allegory.</p>
                        <p>A type or figure is, when any thyng is brought out of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is ſhewed to haue foreſignified, or to haue figured ſome thyng done or to be done in the new Teſtament.</p>
                        <p>An allegorie is when ſome thing either out of the old Teſtament or out of the new is expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with a new ſenſe, and is applyed to ſpirituall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or els to the gouernement of mans life.</p>
                        <p>A type conſiſteth in the compariſon of actes and dedes, and is wholly hyſtoricall.</p>
                        <p>An allegory is occupyed not ſo much in actes, as in orations, ſermons, or ſentences.</p>
                        <p>A type intreateth almoſt of none other thing than of Chriſt, and the Churche, and of the law and the Goſpell, neither is it in all places applied to our tyme and perſons.</p>
                        <p>An allegory intreateth of all things &amp; is very much applied to our per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons which be egged forward, &amp; taught by it vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offices of godlines.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In ſumma,</hi> Types are ſtraitly applied vnto certayne thynges, as of the perſon of Chriſt, of the Churche, of the law, and of the Goſpell.</p>
                        <p>Allegories do largely extend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, and are diſperſed into al mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. VVherby it may happen in one and the ſelfe ſame hiſtory a type may be marked in one place, and an allegory in another place, as interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons greatly different one from another.</p>
                        <p>For if the hiſtory of Dauid, fighting with Goliath, did ſignifie the ſtrife of Chriſt with the deuil whom Chriſt ouercame and vanquiſhed, it is expounded as a type to vs. But if it do ſignifie the conflict of the ſpirit with the fleſh, whiche euery one of vs feleth in him ſelfe, than it is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall expoſition</p>
                        <p>It is no great nor hard matter to gather ſuch like examples. You ſhall read many typicall expoſitions in many places of the new Teſtament. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas being deuoured of the whale, and caſt out agayne,<note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> is deſcribed in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew to be a type or figure of Chriſt buried thre dayes, and riſing agayne from death.</p>
                        <p>The braſen Serpent was a figure of Chriſt crucified.<note place="margin">Ioan. 3.</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:7195:256"/>
                        <p>The Paſchall Lambe, whoſe bones were not broken, was a type and figure of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Ioan. 19. Gala. 4</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The two ſonnes of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Paul do beare a type of the two teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>
                        <p>In whiche place although the Apoſtle declareth, that they were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by an allegorie: yet they may be well ſayd, that they were ſpoken not by an allegorie, but rather by a type, (as Chriſoſtome hath well noted) ſaying,<note place="margin">Comment. in Epiſt. Gal.</note> 
                           <hi>Allegoriae vocabulum ibi pro typo vſurpatur,</hi> that is. This worde Allegorie is vſed there for a type, for beyng a very learned interpreter of the Scriptures, he perceyued that an allegorie and a type differed much. Albeit it cannot be denied, but that an allegorie alſo is there inter mingled, where the Apoſtle interpreteth Hieruſalem to be our mother, meanyng vndoubtedly the Churche gathered by the Gentiles, whiche was alwayes counted baren, but after was made more fruitfull than the Synagoge of the Iewes.</p>
                        <p>If any man deſire to haue more examples whiche open the difference betwene an allegorie and a type, let hym read Cyrillus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Leuiticus where many tymes when Sacrifices rites and ceremonies are intreated of, he firſt declareth, if any type of Chriſt, or of the Churche be had in them Secondly he addeth by an allegorie ſome thyng profitable for our inſtruction.</p>
                        <p>Let this be ſufficient how much an allegorie and type do differre.</p>
                        <p>Now I will proue, where and when it is expedient to vſe allegoricall interpretations, but I wll intreate of them last of all. Neither I can throughly intreate of this parte before I haue diſcuſsed firſt thoſe thinges that pertaine to the Grammaticall ſenſe, than, the thinges pertinent to the morall ſenſe, or as the Apoſtle ſaith,) <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, how be it this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth not alwayes, nor raſhly, but then onely when either the neceſsitie of the ſentence enforceth vs, or the great vtilitie of the hearers perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. I will ſhew how both may happen.</p>
                        <p>There be thre cauſes which enforceth vs by neceſsitie to expounde by an allegorie.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, when the ſcriptures pretend a falſitie, vnleſse you graunt ſome trope to be in them.

                           <p>Vtilitie perſuadeth vs to vſe allegories, as when in preceptes and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les red in the lawe and the Goſpell, the words onely Grammatically and literally taken, do bryng no profitable doctrine nor inſtitution: or if any doctrine do appeare, yet it wilbe more profitable, if an allegoricall inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pretation be vſed.</p>
                           <p>VVhiche thing <hi>I</hi> will make manifeſt by an example. VVe read in the hiſtory of Iacob how he was deceyued of his father in law Laban, how he tooke to his wife Lia, thinckyng that he had gotten Rachell. How that for Rachell he had ſerued many yeares very hardlye, how he by a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent pollicie encreaſed his flocke of ſheepe, laying roddes of diuerſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours into the troughes. Here ſeemeth to be propoſed none or a very ſmall profitable doctrine, but rather guyles, craftines, fooliſhe loue and gredy deſire of riches. VVherfore that ſome fruite may be taken, it is expedient to expounde all theſe thynges by an allegorie. And vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly you ſhall finde a ſweete taſt of the ſpirite vnder the harde barke of the letter, and a pleaſaunt myſterie, whiche is this. Lya, ſignifieth hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Philoſophie, and Rachell may ſignifie diuine Philoſophy, whiche to obtayne, we muſt employe all our labours and diligences. Neyther yet we ought to contemne and reiecte humaine Philoſophie if it happen to be geuen to vs, but yet I ſay the ende and ſcope of all our ſtudyes ought to tende to the obtayning of the knowledge of diuinitie. Neyther can the ſleightes and guyles of Laban, that is of the worlde and the fleſhe hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs from enioyeng at lenght the good thinges whiche we deſire.</p>
                           <p>Other perchaunce may expounde this Hiſtorie another waye more learnedly and more fruitfully.</p>
                           <p>VVe read alſo many ſuch examples in Leuiticus, or in ſome other booke, of Prieſthoode, of ceremonies, of Sacrifices and diuerſe obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, After the Grammatical ſenſe, there commeth no profite of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs, foraſmuch as they be abrogate, and pertayne nothing vnto vs.</p>
                           <p>Therfore that we may take ſome ſpirituall profite out of them, it is expedient to vſe allegoricall interpretations profitablie applyed to the inſtitution and framing of lyfe.</p>
                           <p>So after this ſorte among the Grecians Origenes, Cyrillus, and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherius did expound almoſt all the ceremoniall preceptes of the law, and among the Latines S. Auſten doth ſometyme the ſame.</p>
                           <p>But where the Hiſtories be euident and playne whiche miniſter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable doctrine largely enough by them ſelues, (as many ſuch be in the bookes of Ioſua, the Iudges, Samuell, and the kynges) it would be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to expound them by allegories.</p>
                           <pb n="554" facs="tcp:7195:257"/>
                           <p>Likewiſe where bare preceptes infourmyng manners are contayned as in the Prouerbes, in Eccleſiaſtes, in Iob, and in the Pſalmes, there nede alſo none allegories.</p>
                           <p>Now I will declare how Allegoricall interpretations ought to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and made, whiche may be beſt learned and attayned, rather by vſe and often iudging of examples intreated of other men, than by preceptes and rules.

                           <p n="1">1. That ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may welbe noted of raſhnes, which thinketh, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſcriptures ought to be interpreted in euery place allegorically. Such boldnes emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth maruelouſly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie of the ſcriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the hearers do forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thincke, that there is no certainty in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures, and that it is free for euery man to interprete any place as it pleaſeth him ſelfe, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which cauſe Porphyrius ſcorned the teachers of our religion, ſo likewiſe did Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus the Apoſtata moſt enuiouſly vpbrayde our writers. It behoueth vs alway to perpend and weigh, where neceſsitie requireth it to be done, and where vtilitie perſuadeth it to be done. If in any thing, in this ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ought to be circumſpect and ware.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. If you deſire to frame an allegorie, ſee firſt of al, that the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche you meditate, be found expreſsed in other places of the ſcriptures, plainely and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any figure, and ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vayle beyng drawen away, it may correſpond to the analogie of the faith. For ſeing that euery allegorie is ordayned to teache the hearers of matters of godlines, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that a ſimple doctrine of the truth may appeare in it. VVherfore it is not good to receiue all allegories y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be made by other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but we muſt examine and trie them by the rule and touch ſtone of Gods word.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. VVe muſt take hede that allegories be kept within certaine boundes of doctrine, &amp; that they be chiefly occupied in commun places of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel &amp; of chriſtian doctrin. He that bringeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of theſe bounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he doth iniurie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacred ſcriptures, he alſo hindereth the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers rather than furthereth them: and of him this prouerbe may be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>Extra oleas currit,</hi> that is. He runneth beyond his boundes.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Furthermore an allegorie ought truly to agree in al things with the partes either of the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or of the hiſtory which you take in hand to ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pound, and that it do by no meanes repugne with things goyng before or thinges following, for if your interpretation diſagree and be farre fette, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                              <pb facs="tcp:7195:258"/>5. You ſhall not dwell nor tarie in an allegorie longer than the cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. VVherfore ſome learned men will, that allegories be briefly and pithily touched rather than thoroughly at large intreated. VVhich kinde is vſed in the ſacred ſcriptures, &amp; therfore oght worthily to be followed. As for example:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </note> Thou ſhalt not muſſell the oxes mouth, treading out the corn. doth God care for oxen? Or whether doth he ſpeake this for vs? It is written for vs, that he which ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he whiche treadeth out the corne in hope, ought to be partaker of his hope.</p>
                           <p>The ſame Apoſtle doth very well proſequute that matter whiche he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning the inſtitution of mariage, and of the mutuall loue of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and woman, he expounding them of Christ and the Church, ſaith: <hi>Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium magnum eſt, verum ego loquor de Chriſto &amp; Eccleſia.</hi> It is a great myſterie,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> but I ſpeake of Chriſt and of the Churche.</p>
                           <p>By the whiche interpretation being but ſhort, he greatly ſtirreth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried folkes to their duties, and worthily extolleth matrimonie: for he playnely ſheweth, that the huſbande in the houſe (ſo that it be godly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) beareth and repreſenteth the perſon of Chriſt, and the wife the perſon of the Churche, in ſo much that in a very ſmall familie there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth a certaine image of Chryſte and the Churche.</p>
                           <p>Our ſauiour Chriſt bidding his diſciples to beware of the doctrine of the phariſies and of the Saduces,<note place="margin">Math. 16. Exod 34 2. Cor. 3.</note> vſeth a brief allegorie of leuen. The hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of Moſes coueryng his face is very conningly expounded by Paule of the blindnes of the Iewes</p>
                           <p>Although ſome may ſay, that it is rather a type than an allegorie, yet it may be a very apte allegorie, if we do interprete it of them whiche in our tyme cannot ſuffer the brightneſse of the veritie, and do preferre the traditions of men before the worde of God.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 For ſo much as one and the ſelfe ſame place of the Scripture may be diuerſly interpreted by an allegorie, yet we muſt take hede, that we make not many expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s therof. Or if the place doth ſo require, and per aduenture is founde diuerſly expounded of the learneder ſorte: yet that onely expoſition is to be vſed whiche hath more grace and more agreeth to the purpoſe, and is occupyed in commune places, and is alſo read to be approued in other places of Scriptures Auguſtine hath this rule: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had interpreted by an allegorie this verſe (and thoſe that folowe, <hi>omnia ſubieciſti ſub pedibus eius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oues &amp; boues. &amp;c.</hi> that is. Thou haſt put all thinges vnder his fete ſhepe and oxen. &amp; cetera.) of the power of Chriſt, he added in the ende this. <hi>Non quia iſta nomina iſto ſolum modo intelligi &amp; explicari poſſunt, ſed pro locis nam aliud alibi ſignificant,</hi> that is. Not becauſe theſe woordes may be vnderſtood and expounded
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7195:258"/> onely after this maner, but for the places, for they ſignifie an other thing in other places of Scriptures. And this rule is to be reteyned in all allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that that may be conſidered and weighed for the meaning of the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent place, whiche is ſpoken by a ſimilitude.</p>
                           <p>Theſe notes concerning Allegories ſhall ſuffiſe.</p>
                           <p>Finally I will declare what is the vſe of Allegories, and how farre they muſt be admitted. They ought to be diſcretly and ſeldome vſed, and ye muſt alwayes haue reſpect to the hearers, and ſpecially to them that be weake: for although you do handle them rightly, yet all men do not vnderſtand them in one ſenſe. VVherfore it is very requiſite, to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in collectyng the morall doctrine, or rather accordyng to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles mynde, in diſcuſsing, ſearching, and ſettyng foorth of doctrines, in reprouynges, in inſtructions, in corrections and comfortynges, this is the iudgement of the beſt part of learned men.</p>
                           <p>It chaunceth many times, that he whiche is bolde to frame oftentimes allegories, falleth into errour, &amp; vttereth ſometime that, which learned and good men do contemne, and the vnlearned and maleuolous do ſcorne and ſcoffe at, and wherewith alſo the weake be offended.</p>
                           <p>Origene is ill reported of the learned, althoughe he be not obſcure in Allegories.</p>
                           <p>Ambroſe alſo appeareth to be taunted of Hierome, for that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon Luke,<note place="margin">In. Commen.

                           <p>Yea and the hearers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues do oftentimes count it, to be as lawfull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to dally &amp; play with allegories, as it is for the teacher.

                           <p>Fourthly, if an allegorie be brought for the confirmation of doctrine, it ſhall haue the laſt place, that is, it ſhalbe brought after all other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes brought out of the Scriptures, which arguments euidently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out figures and obſcurities do confirme and eſtabliſhe that whiche is the principall and chief aſsertion by neceſſary conſequentes and concluſions.</p>
                           <p>By theſe conditions allegories may take place, and it is certayne, that they beyng thus made, ſhall not onely not do hurte, but alſo bring ſome no ſmall commoditie.</p>
                           <p>Now to conclude, Allegories do delight, teache, and ſet foorth a very riche plentifulnes of the Scriptures.</p>
                           <p>And in deede it cannot be, but the auditours may get ſome fruite by ſondry interpretations made with iudgement.</p>
                           <p>That whiche ſauoureth not to one mans mouth, wilbe pleaſaunt to an other mans mouth.</p>
                           <p>Some men were greatly delighted with heauenly Manna, but other mens ſtomackes did loth it. Euen ſo in a greate multitude, there bee ſome whom the ſondry and manifolde expoſition of the Scriptures doo pleaſe, but there be other whom it diſpleaſeth.</p>
                           <p>That thyng pleaſeth euery man most wherwith he is affectioned. But vnderſtand this of the puritie of ſincere doctrine. For the doctrine which is vnpure and corrupte of it ſelfe, how can it profite, any wayes? nay it doth great hurt.</p>

And it may be wel called a peace, <hi>nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, et non re,</hi> in name onely, and not in dede. The Chriſtians onelye haue the true peace, yea in the very middle of tumults, of battle and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they haue a quiet conſcience, and are armed with the word of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne, death, Sathan, hel, and the world.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> They know that althings worke together vnto them for the beſt, they know, that to the cleane all thinges are cleane, that al thinges are ſubiect vnto them, that ther is no condemnation vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are in Chriſt Ieſus They know, that they haue a father in heauen, louing and mercyful, who hath care ouer them, and nouriſheth them, out of whoſe hands they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be taken away.<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> And what nedeth many words? the faithfull onely acknowledge and glorifye God.

This peace the Chriſtians do gladly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with others, they preach Chriſt, in whoſe bloud they promis re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſsion of ſinnes, they embrace charity, they do not ſtriue, they are not en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uious, they worke deceit againſt no man. They lay aſide all iniuries and wronges, they offend no man, they ſpoil no man, but rather they helpe al men, geuing of their own.</p>
                        <p>And this is to turne the ſwoord into coulters, to laye aſide pride, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye, and the malice of the minde, to helpe and ſuccour the neceſsities of our brethren, to hurt no man, to hate ſtrife, and to deſire peace. If the Iewes had vnderſtanden this peace, they woulde not haue dreamed of the carnall kingdome of Chriſte. VVherefore there is none other kingedome of Chriſte to be looked for vpon the earthe, for it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy begonne amonges vs by the preaching of the Goſpel, bicauſe all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are called vnto this kingdome, and we which haue receiued the firſt fruites of the ſpirite, are abiding in this kingdome through faith, hope, and charitye. In the ende of the world it ſhall be finiſhed and declared, what we haue hoped for,<note place="margin">1. Ioan. 3. 1. Cor. 13.</note> and what we haue beleued. Then we ſhall be like vnto Chriſt, and we ſhall ſee him, as he is. <hi>Nunc videmus perſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in aenigmate, tunc autem facie ad faciem.</hi> Now we ſee throughe a glaſſe darkely, but then ſhall we ſee face to face, that is, we ſhal haue the truth, not a ſhadow, we ſhal rayne truly and be glorified.</p>
                        <p>Therfore ſuche thinges as are ſpoken of the Prophetes concerninge the peace in the kingdome of Chriſt, are to be vnderſtanded ſpirituallye. That peace is in the ſpirite and the mindes of the godly, and not a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, fleſhly and worldly tranquillity, as certain falſe Prophets dreame, who thincke that then ther ſhall be one paſtour, and one fold according vnto their fond fantaſie, faith engendereth that ſpirituall peace through the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>They that heare the Goſpel and beleue, they haue that peace, of the which all the prophets ſo manifeſtly and often haue prophecied. That is called the peace of God,<note place="margin">Philip 4 Coloſſ 3.</note> bicauſe god only geueth it, and chriſt came to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite it vnto the world. But as for the other peace which is of the fleſh, he came not to bring, but rather to diſſolue, that we ſhould be at diſcord and perpetual hatred with the world, that is, that we ſhould not put any affiaunce in thinges tranſitory, but that we ſhould haue peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with God onely through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.

                           <hi>1</hi> Of the firſt conſcience which is called <hi>praeſumptuoſa,</hi> preſumptuous, ſaint Bernard writeth, ſaying: <hi>Conſcientia quaedam eſt tranquilla, ſed non bona, vt eorum qui ſpe veniae peccant, et dicunt in corde ſuo quod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us non requiret.</hi> There is a certaine conſcience, and yet not good, as of them which ſinne vpon hope of forgeuenes, ſaying in their hart, that god wil not require it of them.

                           <hi>2</hi> The ſecond conſcience is called <hi>larga,</hi> large and broad. Such a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue they, which onely weigh great and hainous ſinnes, and make no accompt of the leſſer offences, eſteeming them to be no ſinne. As for example: They care not for vſual ſwearing nor periury, except it be com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted ſolemply before a iudge. They thinke it no offence to vſe them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues inordinatly with their own wiues. Alſo to take vſury for loue, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in byeng and ſelling, to vſe falſe weightes, and counterfeit coyne, they count it nothing. Alſo to prole and diminiſhe the common goods of the church, to ſpoyle by vniuſt battell, they compt them as no offences. But what difference is ther, whether a man be drowned in the great &amp; deepe ſea, or in a lyttle riuer, ſince that he can but once dye in both.</p>

                     <p>The labours and payns of lerned men either old or new, are not to be condemned, becauſe they expound the Scriptures diuerſly euery man for his vnderſtandyng.

For the diuerſitie of iudgements and expoſitions, doth profite a wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that no man do raſhly condemne the writer, that diſsenteth from him, or breaketh the bonde of peace in the Churche.</p>
                     <p>Agayne to the matter, I iudge that it may be well weighed and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered if the doings of the old fathers which admitted infantes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords ſupper be diſcretly diſtinguiſhed from the cauſe that moued them therto.

                     <p>The third is, becauſe Chriſt ſayd. <hi>Sinite paruulos venire ad me, &amp; ne prohibeatis eos. &amp;c.</hi> Suffer litle ones to com vnto me, &amp; forbid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, for theirs is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom of heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for by theſe reſons we may gather thus. Firſt if he may be partaker of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſign which partaketh the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Infants alſo of the faithful be partakers of the death of Chriſt, that is, of the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, which is purchaced by it. Therfore they may be parta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kers of the ſigne &amp; Sacrament of his death, that is, of the Lordes ſupper.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if infantes do pertayne to the Church, whiche is the body of Chriſt: It foloweth that they do belong to that communion, by whiche (as
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7195:267"/> the Apoſtle ſaith) we be all one body, whiche be partakers of one bread and one cup Chriſt is the meat of the whole body, therfore he is the meate alſo of the infantes.</p>
                     <p>VVherfore like as the infantes of the Hebrues did no leſſe pertayne to the Paſcha (being a Sacrament of their redemption,) then their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: So alſo our infants do ſo well pertayn to the Sacrament of our new Paſcha, aſwell as we.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly if Chriſt him ſelfe voucheſaued to haue infantes to come vnto him, to embrace and to lay his handes vpon them, and to bleſſe them, how ſhall we iudge them vnworthy to be admitted to the Sacrament of his body and bloud, for ſomuch as no man iudgeth the Sacrament to be pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferred before Chriſt him ſelfe?</p>
                     <p>Now to the place of ſaint Paul, let a man proue him ſelf,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> and ſo let him eate of that bread, and drincke of that cup. It may be aunſwered, that it ought to be vnderſtand onely of them which ſtand in daunger to eate the bread, and to drincke of the cup of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord vnworthily, as the text it ſelf manifeſtly declareth. But this is not to be fered in infants of the faithful, whom we may not well call vnworthy of the Lordes table, for that they be worthy by the grace of Christ, being incorporate to him in Baptiſme, although they cannot for their age either beleue or confeſſe their fayth, or proue them ſelues, whiche thinges are well required of them that be of age. VVheras the Apoſtle moniſheth vs to proue our ſelues before we do partake of this bread and cup of the lord, he doth it not to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our comming to the Lordes table ſhould be obtained of this ſtudy of prouyng our ſelues, but that we ſhould not raſhly and lightly receiue the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of grace abuſing it, and ſinning againſt the body and bloud of our Lord.</p>
                     <p>This reaſon reſtraineth not the infants of the faithfull from beyng par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>takers of the body and bloud of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>After this maner might ſome man obiect for the defence of geuyng the Sacrament to infantes, and to defend the doynges of the old fathers, who taught that infantes ought to communicate.</p>

                        <p>But S. Paul requireth an other maner of preparing and probatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But ſo hot a prouer as Galatinus is, and ſo cold probations ſaw you neuer. I ſpeake vnder correction of the learned.</p>
                     <p>I will rehearſe vnto you the wordes of a godly Byſhop and conſtaunt Martir of England concernyng this matter. Beyng occaſioned (ſaid he) by ſome men whiche gaue to much deuotion to our Lady without iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as though ſhe had not needed Chriſt to ſaue her. To proue Chriſt her ſauiour, to make Chriſte a whole Sauioure of all that be or ſhall bee ſaued: I reaſoned after this maner. Either ſhee was a ſinner, or no ſinner. There is no meane, if ſhee were a ſinner, then ſhee was preſerued from ſinne by Chriſte: ſo that Chriſte ſaued her, and was her neceſſarie ſauiour, whether ſhe ſinned or no Now certayne authours (ſayd I) as Chriſoſtome, Theophilact, and other, writeth as though ſhe had ben ſome thyng faulty in her tyme. Alſo I ſayd, that certayne Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtandeth ſome thyng to the ſame, vnleſse they be the more warely vnderſtanded. As theſe Scriptures. All haue declined, that euery mouth be ſtopped, and all the worlde is bounden in daunger to God. Agayn, all haue ſinned, and nede the grace of God. Alſo death paſſed through into all men and women, for aſmuch as al haue ſinned. But to theſe Scriptures I ſayd, it might be aunſwered, that the priuiledge of one or of a fewe doo not derogate or miniſhe the veritie of an vniuerſall expoſition in Scriptures. And as to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctours <hi>I</hi> ſayd, that other mo ſaith otherwayes, and for aſmuch as now it is vniuerſally &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly receiued &amp; applied, that ſhe was no ſinner, it becommeth euery man to ſtand and agre to the ſame, and ſo will I (quod I) nor any man that wiſe is, wil do the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie:
<pb facs="tcp:7195:269"/> But to my purpoſe, it is neither to nor from, to proue neither this nor that, for I will haue her ſaued, and Chriſt her Sauiour, whether euer ſhe was a ſinner, or no ſinner. And to that, (ſome ſayd) what nede you to ſpeake of this? I aunſwered, great nede: when men cannot be contented, that ſhe was a creature ſaued, but as it were a Sauioreſſe, nor nedyng of ſaluation, it is neceſſarie to ſet her in her degree, to the glorie of Chriſt, creatour and ſauiour of all that be or ſhalbe ſaued. Good authours haue written, that ſhe was not a ſinner: but good authours neuer wrote that ſhe was not ſaued, for though ſhe neuer ſinned, yet ſhe was not ſo impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, but that ſhe mighte haue ſinned, if ſhe had not bene preſerued. It was of the goodnes of God that ſhe neuer ſinned It had come of her owne ilnes, if ſhe had ſinned. There was difference betwixte her and Chriſt. And I will geue as litle to her as I can (doyng her no wrong) rather then Chriſt her ſonne and Sauiour ſhould lack any parcell of his glorie. I am ſure, that our Lady will not be diſpleaſed with me for ſo doynge, for our Lady ſought his glorie here vpon earth, ſhe would not defraude hym nowe in heauen, but ſome are ſo ſuperſtitiouſly religious, ſo prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly deuoute towarde our Lady, as though there could not to much be geuen to her. Such are zeleous without knowledge and iudgement, to our Ladies diſpleaſure. No doubt, our Lady was throughe the goodnes of God, a good and a gracious creature, a deuoute handmayd of the Lord, indued with ſingular giftes and graces from aboue, whiche through the helpe of God ſhe vſed to Gods pleaſure, accordyng to her dutie, ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng vs enſample to do likewyſe: ſo that all the goodnes that ſhe had, ſhe hadde it not of her ſelfe, but of God the authour of all goodnes: the Lorde was with her fauourablie, and powred graces into her plentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: as it is in the Aue Marie. The ſonne of God whan he would be come man to ſaue both man and woman, did choſe her to hys mother, whiche loue he ſhewed to her alone and to none other, of his benigne goodnes, by the whiche ſhe was the naturall mother of Chriſte: and through fayth in Chriſt, ſhe was the ſpirituall ſiſter of Chriſte, ſaued by Chriſt, bleſſed by hearyng Chriſtes worde, and kepyng the ſame. It ſhould not haue auailed her to ſaluation to haue bene his natural mother, if ſhe had not done the will of his heauenly father. By hym ſhe was his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by hym ſhe did the will of his father: She was the handemayden, he is the Lorde. The handemayden did magnifie her Lorde, the handmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den would that all ſhould magnifie the Lorde, to whome be honour and glorie. Amen.</p>
                     <p>Theſe be the words of that godly and conſtant preacher. But whither he conſidered and had a reſpect to the corrupte tyme, when he ſpake
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7195:269"/> theſe woordes, or els that he would geue no offence to the weakelynges not able to receyue as yet whole meate, he ſemeth in theſe woordes to graunt the ſcholaſticall diſtinction <hi>De duplici redemptione, id eſt, ſuble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiua, &amp; preſeruatina.</hi> The ſchole men ſay that <hi>Redemptio preſeruatiua,</hi> is more noble and more perfecte, then <hi>Redemptio ſubleuatiua.</hi> As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. It is much better to preſerue a man from receyuing a wounde, then to geue him remedie after the wounde is geuen. So is it more noble and muche better to preſerue one that he fall not into ſinne, then to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hym from ſinne after his fall Euen ſo the Virgine Marie, and none but ſhe, was redemed by Chriſt, <hi>Redemptione preſeruatiua,</hi> whiche farre excelleth <hi>Redemptionem ſubleuatiuam,</hi> wherwithall ſinners are rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from ſinne. Thus reaſon the ſcholemen.</p>
                     <p>But if the Scriptures be well weyghed and vnderſtanded, it will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appeare that none, no not the virgine Marie was exempted from Originall ſinne (Chriſt alway excepted)</p>
                     <p>Saint Paule writyng to the Romaines doth ſay.<note place="margin">De fide ad pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trum parte prima q. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Omnes in Adam pec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauerunt &amp; egent gratia Dei.</hi> All haue ſinned in Adam and want the grace of God. VVherupon it foloweth neceſsarily that Marie ſinned in Adam, and that <hi>Prima materia eius,</hi> was infected with the ſinne of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſo corrupted in originall ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Secondly if Marie ſhould haue ben conceiued without Originall ſin, ſhe ſhould haue ben begotten <hi>Sine concupiſcentia,</hi> without luſt,<note place="margin">De fide ad petrum.</note> which Saint Auguſtine doth denie, his wordes be theſe. Holde ſtedfaſtly and doubt not by no meanes, that euery perſon whiche is conceiued by copulation of man and woman, is borne with Originall ſinne, and ſubiecte vnto death. And all that be borne with luſte of copulation, are conceyued with Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne. Then ſeyng that the virgine Marie was begotten by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of father and mother, ſhe muſt nedes as other are, be begotten in Originall ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly if the virgine Marie ſhould be vtterly voyde of ſinne, Chriſt had not bene an vniuerſall redemer,<note place="margin">3. diſt. queſt. 3</note> whiche to graunte were verie incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniente. Therfore Chriſt was alſo her redemer and Sauiour, as ſhe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth her ſelfe in her ſonge, ſaying. <hi>Et exultauit ſpiritus meus in deo ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari meo,</hi> and my ſpirite reioyced in God my ſauiour. Now redemption or ſaluation doth preſuppoſe ſinne, for none can be ſayd to be redemed or ſaued, except it were from ſome ſinne. The redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche the ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call <hi>Preſeruatiuam,</hi> ſemeth more ſuttle then ſauerie.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and finally, Aquinas writeth after this manner. <hi>Alius error fuit eorum qui dicunt, quod peccante Adam, Dominus aliquid incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; non infectum in Adam conſeruauit, per quod natura humana ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uari poſſet, &amp; quod hoc ide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> transfuſum eſt ſine aliqua infectione ad bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> virginem, &amp; exinde formatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt corpus Chriſti, hoc aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erroneu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatur
<pb facs="tcp:7195:270"/> propter duo,</hi> that is. There was an other errour, of whiche they ſay, that when Adam ſinned, the Lord preſerued ſome thyng incorrupt, and not infect in Adam, by the whiche the nature of man myght be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. They alſo ſay, that the ſame thyng was transfuſed without any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into the virgine Marie, and that of that, the body of Chriſt was fourmed and made. But this is erroneous for two cauſes, firſt, becauſe after this poſition, Chriſt ſhould not be the ſonne of the virgin, nor ſhould be borne of any ſtocke or linage but onely of Adam, for that part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it remayned vncorrupte in the nature of man, ſhould be farre fet and ſtraunge from all other, beyng borne of Adam, and ſhould be proper and connaturall onely vnto Adam, as much as concerneth the firſt ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe the due order of ſignification ſhould be taken away, for as it was not decent, that any ſhould ſatisfie for Adam and his corrupt ſucceſsion, whiche were not of his ſtocke, ſo it had not ben mete that the ſonne of God ſhould haue healed by ſatisfaction, a nature infected, vnles he had taken that thing whiche before was infected. Therfore it is to be ſayd, that the fleſhe of Chriſt, as concerning beyng in the fleſh of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, yea and in the virgine Marie, was infected with ſinne before it was taken. But in the very actuall takyng of the fleſh, it is purged from all infection, ſo that concernynge the fleſhe of Chriſte, there is founde no ſpot in it. Theſe be the wordes of Thomas. By whiche it appeareth that the fleſhe of the Virgine was infected with originall ſinne. He that will read more of this matter <hi>Pro &amp; contra,</hi> Let him read Galatinum, in his booke, <hi>De arcanis Catholicae veritatis.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:7195:271"/> being aliue, he ouercame being dead.

                     <p>Becauſe I haue made mencion of Aaron, being high Prieſt, I will geue you ſome notes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his apparell and the ſignification therof.</p>
                     <p>There are nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred nine kinds of the apparell belonging to the Prieſts: ſome nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber but eight, but Ioſephus reciteth tene. Firſt of all the Prieſts were waſhed with cleane water before they went to do Sacrifice, and then they did put on their holy garmentes. There was certaine apparell common to the high Prieſt and to the other Prieſtes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt the Prieſtes had lynnen breches to couer their priuities, whiche
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7195:271"/> breeches did reache from their loines, vnto their thighs, the higher part wherof was made firſt aboue the huckle bone, much like vnto our truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hoſe, that when they ſhould do ſacrifice, and draw or beare any bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, if they fel, the thing that ought to be cloſe, ſhould not be ſene. Then they put on a ſhort and ſtraight coate without ſleues, which ſat plain vp on the body, without plaite or wrinkle, and reached downe to the calfe of the legge.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they had a girdle which girded the ſame coate vnto them. This girdle was made of purple ſcarlet, fine linnen, and blew ſilke. The endes of the which girdle ſhould hang downe to the calfe of the leg, but in their miniſtery they caſt it vpon their left ſhoulder.</p>
                     <p>The fourth kinde of garment was a round cap, or a myter, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the head to the eares.</p>
                     <p>The fift maner of garment was the Ephod, whiche was the vtmoſt part. It was a roabe made of linnen. Suche a garment did Dauid weare when he daunced before the Arke. This Ephod was not much vnlike our Surplices.</p>
                     <p>Theſe fiue kindes of garments were common both to the high Prieſt and to the inferiour prieſtes. The other foure ſortes of garmentes were proper onely to the high prieſt. The firſt garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was called Megil, which was a broad garment, re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>aching down to the heeles, made all together of blew ſilke, and was al whole, ſauing that it had two holes to put out the prieſtes head and his armes. It had beneath in the ſkirts <hi>.72.</hi> bels of gold, and ſo many Pomegranets of blew ſilke, ſo ſet, that betwene euery two bels was a Pomegranate, and betwene euery two Pomegranates a bell, which was done for this cauſe that when Aaron miniſtred, a ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d might be heard when he went into the holy place before the Lord. For if he had gone without this garment, they ſhould haue died.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond garment of the high prieſt was an Ephod, nothinge lyke the Ephod, mencioned before, for it was not linnen, but made of cloth of gold, and was girded vnto him, wherin was the breſt plate, with the .xii. ſtones, which was tied about with two chaines to two Onix ſtones, and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth with two laces. In the two Onix ſtones were engraued the names of the twelue tribes of Iſrael vi. vpon the one ſtone, and ſix vpon the other, which two ſtones were vpon the ſhoulders of the Ephod.</p>
                     <p>The third garment was called, <hi>Rationale,</hi> whiche the Hebrewes call <hi>hoſen,</hi> which was the breſt plate of iudgement, ſo called, bicauſe the high prieſt could not geue iudgement without that on his breſt. It was made of gold, blew ſilke, purple ſcarlet and fine trimmed linnen. It was foure ſquare, and double a hand breadth longe, and a hand breadth broade. It was full of places for ſtones euen foure rowes of ſtones, which ſtones wer
<pb facs="tcp:7195:272"/> according to the names of the children of Iſrael. In this breſt plate was put alſo theſe two words, Vrim, and Thummim, which were vpon Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons hart. Vrim ſignifieth light, and Thummim perfection. Vrim alſo doth ſignify knowledge, Thummim holynes, ſhewing what vertues are required in the Prieſtes.</p>
                     <p>Some interprete and turne Vrim Thummim, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, <hi>doctrina &amp; veritas,</hi> doctrine and truth, wherby is ſignified, that Prieſts ought to be able to preach doctrine, but yet none other but true doctrin.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and laſt kind of garment was, a myter, &amp; ther was made a plate of pure gold, which had grauen theron, <hi>ſanctum domino,</hi> holines to the Lord. It was ſet vpon the high Prieſtes for head. And this plate of gold was tied with blew ſilke lace vpon the fronte of the myter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe garments had a godly and manifold ſignification. God him ſelfe declared by Moſes the vſe and the end of them, that they were inſtituted vnto the glory and comlynes of the Prieſts, which garments did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procure an authority vnto the Miniſters, being occupied about the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, but alſo made the ſacrifices commendable. For they muſt needes appeare glorious, whiche are celebrate with ſo great pompe and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, it was profitable and neceſſary, that the people being very prone to embrace the rites of the Heathen, ſhould be kept within the compaſſe of their duties by theſe ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, they do exhibite Chriſt the true and high prieſt to be conſidered of vs. He was appareled with the garment of iuſtice, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce and vertue, which garment he hath common with vs, for it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth al Chriſtians to put vpon them, Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt excelleth as an high prieſt, not onely in that he ſanctifieth vs, and indueth vs with vertues, but alſo hath certaine peculiar properties, as a true God and Sauiour of the world. He beareth vs on his ſhoulders and in his breſt, as precious ſtones, for we be not vile, but precious in his ſight. The light of the eternal wiſdome ſhineth out of the breſt of Chriſt our Biſhop. For in him, as in a cheſte of the euerlaſting wiſdome of God, are al treaſures of wiſdome &amp; knowledge layd vp. He is the light of the world, he is truth and perfection, that al the world of onely Chriſt maye aſke iuſtly lawes, oracles, and whatſoeuer nedeth to the obtaining of perr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection, and true bleſſednes. He is <hi>Sanctus ſanctorum,</hi> the diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and holynes it ſelfe, vpon whoſe head the crowne of glory doth wel &amp; rightly ſit, who onely doth ſanctify, raigneth glorious, &amp; liueth for euer.</p>
                     <p>Finally, theſe ceremonies were ordained for the prieſts, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might vnderſtand by their apparell, what was required of them, and of what condicions they ought to be. Let prieſts be alwaies prepared to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7195:272"/> Let them walke honeſtly in the ſighte of God and menne. Let them kepe a temperaunce, and be voyde from riot and euill luſtes. Let theyr loynes be girded w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the girdle of iuſtice and truth. Let their breſts, ſides, and backes be ſenſed with the word of God. Let their heades be couered with the helmet of ſaluation, in Chriſt our Sauiour. Let him be the head of the Miniſters, and miniſtery, but eſpecially let him be a vocall Prieſt ſpeaking in the Church. For if the prieſt be dum, he ſhal die, but if he doo boldly preache the name of the Lord, and his law, he raiſeth vp a ſweete ſauour of Pomegranates in the Church. Therfore, vnder the ſhadow of the garments, are couered maners, vertues, and vices. Next after prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, nothing doth more commend and ſet foorth man, then garmentes. Such as the minde is, ſuch almoſt are the words and garments. Therfore the garment ſignifieth a mans conuerſation. Vvherupon we are commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in holy talke to put on an other garment, when conuerſacion is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be chaunged. In ſo much that a good part of prieſtly doctrine is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained by a ſhadow, what becommeth them in this apparel of Aaron.</p>

                        </gap>, which ſignifieth <hi>forma,</hi> a forme or ſhape which men haue inuented vnto them ſelues, to repreſent a God with all. And as ther are found diuers and ſundry kindes of matter, whereof the idoles are made: ſo ther are diuers kindes of idoles. If it be ſtone, wood, or metall, wherof the god is made, &amp; in it to be worſhipped, thoſe are groſe &amp; moſt manifeſt idoles. Somtimes the matter of them is ſpirituall, which than happeneth, when thoſe formes and images are none other things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conceptions of the minde, by which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do imagine to repreſent God him ſelfe, not as the ſcripture ſetteth him forth, but according to their own phantaſy and raſhnes.</p>
                     <p>Vvherfore ther are two ſortes of idoles, according to the condicion of the matter, of the which the one is called externall and viſible, the other internall and inuiſible, which is imagined in minde.</p>
                     <p>Alſo ther are two true kindes of worſhipping of God, the one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when we beleue in God, put our truſt in him, &amp; geue him thanks, and ſubmit our ſelues and al ours vnto him, and call vpon him deuoutlye in our praiers. In theſe actions conſiſt the inwarde worſhipping of God. The other kinde of worſhipping of god hath external notes, by the which we teſtify this our mind, as in proſtrating of the bodye, in bowing of the knee, in vncouering the head, in ſpeaking &amp; in exerciſing thoſe rites &amp; ceremonies, which are inſtituted of God. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward honoring
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7195:274"/> of God. But it is to be noted, that ſuch externall ſignes, as of bowing the body and the knees, and ſuch like are done alſo vnto creatures, as vnto Princes &amp; Kings, which repreſent the authority of God, vnto men here in earth, and execute his office in the adminiſtration of thinges. And then truly they are to be eſtemed no otherwiſe then certain manifeſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, by the which al they which ar appointed in this inferior place, do declare truly and from the bottom of their hart, that they are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Gods ſake to be ſubiect, and to obey ſuch higher powers, as farre as godlines, and Gods word doth permit.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt take heede, leaſt in our inward iudgement we attribute more vnto them, than is meete or expedient, and looke for greater things at their handes, then their authority and power is able to perfourme: for otherwiſe we ſhall not auoide idolatry.</p>
                     <p>Vvherfore, if any man by bowing him ſelfe vnto his Prince, woulde ſignify thereby, that the Prince cannot erre, and that it is lawfull for him to do what he liſt, to his pleaſure, and to commaund whatſoeuer he liſteth, ſuch a one without doubt ſhould commit idolatry, both inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly.</p>
                     <p>Vvhether this fault be in the bondſlaues of the Pope or no, we maye gather of this, that they ſo humble them ſelues vnto him, that they doo kis his feete. They declared that they were ſo ſubiect vnto him, as vnto the onely Vicar of Chriſt vpon earth, and as to the vniuerſall Biſhop of the Church, who cannot erre in the faith, vnto whom onely power is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to diſcerne and iudge of religion, and of Chriſtian doctrine at hys pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Let this therfore be a ſure and a firme rule, that the exteriour hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the body, whenſoeuer it is a token and witnes of the mind, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting vnto a creature more then is lawfull, or ſuch thinges as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto God onely: that then it doth pertaine vnto idolatry, for they are not referred vnto God him ſelfe, or vnto the obedience of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, but vnto vaine formes and ſhapes, which we faine to our ſelues, and conceiue in our mindes.</p>
                     <p>Twoo places of the ſcripture offer them ſelues here to be diſcuſſed, which make for the confirmation of the doctrine which we intreate of.<note place="margin">Actorum. 10</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt is in the Actes of the Apoſtles, of Cornelius the Centurion, who fell down proſtrate vnto Peters feete, when Peter came vnto him, but Peter could not abide it, but reproued him, ſaying: <hi>Ne ſic feceris, ſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge, ego quoque homo ſum.</hi> Do not ſo, aryſe, for I am a man alſo.<note place="margin">Apo. 22.</note> Vve reade alſo in the Apocalips, how that Iohn fel downe before the Angell, but he charged him that he ſhould not ſo doo, ſaying: <hi>Conſeruus tuus ſum.</hi> I am thy fellow ſeruaunt.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7195:275"/>
                     <p>Theſe two places might be thus vnderſtanded, as though Peter and the angel condemned theſe actions as idolatrous, and as though the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Iohn ſhould geue vnto them ſome diuine honour, and ſhould geue more reuerence vnto them, than is meete to be geuen vnto any creature. But ſuch impiety is not to be thought to haue bene in any of them. The ſcripture is a witnes vnto the Centurion, that he feared and worſhipped God.</p>
                     <p>Howe can we thinke therfore, that he would take Peter for a God, or at the leaſt wiſe would geue any diuine honour vnto a creature? And it is not likely, that Iohn being an Apoſtle, could not diſcerne an Angell from God. If that none of them woulde worſhippe a creature in ſteade of the creatour, it followeth, that it is not lawfull to exhibite this kinde of outward reuerence to creatures. Vvherefore it ſhoulde ſeeme alſo that thys reuerence ought not to be done vnto princes. To this <hi>I</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that we ought to put a difference betwene worldly honour, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine honour.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, we muſt vnderſtand, that theſe twoo menne, that is Cornelius and Iohn did not minde by this their woorſhipping, to take Gods honor from him, and to geue it vnto menne: yet it might be thought that they fell to an inordinate ſigne of reuerence, and ſo offended in exceſſe, and paſſed their bounds, but committed not idolatry. But ther is leſſe fear of committing idolatry toward Princes, than towardes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt. For they, becauſe they execute a ſpirituall function, the honor which is done vnto them, doth come nigher vnto a religious ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>VVherfore the bowing of the knee, and the incuruation of the body in them ſelues, are not condemned, but in that they are done for the cauſe of religion. Vvherfore in this caſe a moderation is to be vſed. And let this be ſufficiently ſayd of this matter. Take this alſo by the way, that this doth alſo pertayne vnto idolatry, when we worſhip the true God by other meanes and rites then he would haue vs, or hath preſcribed and appointed vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>If we do otherwiſe, we ſhal worſhip an idoll, according vnto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond forme of idolatry, ſpoken of before, that is, when we fayne vnto our ſelues in our mynde and thought ſome God, which is delighted wyth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour inuented by man, wheras there is no ſuch God at all. Vvherfore in this doing we ſhall not worſhip the true God, but an idole which we haue conceiued in our minde.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely Paule is thus to be vnderſtanded in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, wher he ſaith: <hi>Scimus quod idolum nihil eſt in mundo.</hi> Vve know that an idole is nothing in the world. Paule doth not meane,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7195:275"/> that ther is no idole, as concerning the outward ſhape and fourme, for no man doubteth, but that the idoles haue place, either in ſome extern mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or in our mindes. Vvherfore he meaneth not the ſigne of the idole, but the thing, vnto the which the idole is referred: meaning, that the thing it ſelfe which is ſignified by the idoles, is nothing, bicauſe there is no God any where, which would be repreſented or delighted wyth ſuch images.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the name of Baal, it is to be noted, that a goodly Epithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of God is expreſſed therby. For Baal in the Hebrue betokeneth a Lord, a Maiſter, a Huſbande, which all things agree in very deede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. For he is the Lord of all, he is the teacher of all true wyſedome, he is the onely huſbande of the Church. Therfore they doo not erre, who conſidering the properties of God, doo call him by this name Baal. Nor the Grecians are to be reprehended, when they named God <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, bycauſe with that title they declared God to be the authour of life.</p>
                     <p>Of the Romanes alſo God was called Iupiter, as they would ſay, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Father. Theſe woordes therfore are worthy to be attributed vnto God. And it might be that the Elders which ſo ſpake, had reſpect to the true God, Prince of all thinges: but afterward, it was moſt wycked and deteſtable to geue theſe properties to planets, ſtarres, men, beaſtes, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherupon althinges were filled with idolatry.</p>

It may be the part of your godlines and iuſtice, after the copy and tranſlation written out, to ſend it againe vnto vs by the bearers hereof. And after a certain ſpace when the Elders wer come from Hieruſalem, to the king being in Alex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>andria, they wer entertained of him very honorably, &amp; moſt curteouſly.

                     <p>Vvho when they had inſtructed and taught the king in the knowledge of the onely God, and in the gouernment of his kingdome, thanking him much, returned to Eleazarus with very many rewardes.</p>

                     <p>Tertullian ſaith, that Menedemus, a Philoſopher of the prouince of Iewry, did much maruaile at the one conſent of their interpretation.</p>
                     <p>Saint Hierome ſomtime doth attribute much to them, ſaying, that they were full of the holye ghoſt, affirming alſo that oft times they did tranſlate vnexpertly, and very ill. But he ſcoffeth and mocketh at the Cels, writing thus. <hi>Neſcio quis primus author ſeptuaginta cellulas Alex andriae mendacio ſuo extruxit. &amp;c.</hi> That is: I know not who was the firſt authour of this lye, that ther were ſeuenty Cels, builded at Alexandria, in which houſes, the interpreters being ſeperated, did write and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete all a like. For ſo much as neither Ariſtenus, which was Ptolemeus familiar friend, nor Ioſephus (who was lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time after) recorded any ſuch thing. But they both wrote, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei aſſembled together in one large place.</p>
                     <p>Great learned men do attribute to the <hi>.70.</hi> interpreters ſo much, that they thinke nothing to haue ben tranſlated of them, but that the holy ghoſt it ſelfe hath ſpoken and ratified it. Vnto theſe therfore, al ſtudents of Gods booke (hauing any ſight in the toungs) ought to repair and run, as the Hart runneth to the fountaines of water, according to the ſaying of the Prophet. But (vnder correction of the better learned, and that I may ſpeake it with their pacience) many places are found in their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations more perplex, and wrapped in greater darknes, then they be in the Latine verſion, which might chaunce partly through the phraſe of the Hebrue toung, being farre diſſonant from the Greeke phraſe, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throughe the corruptinge of the text, or the negligence of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Some perchaunce maye note in me preſumptuous raſhneſſe, that I which haue taſted of the holye tounge, but <hi>tanquam canis e Nuo,</hi> doo take vppon me to ſhewe their errours and negligence in tranſlating.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:7195:277"/> But I wil (by Gods grace) ſhew manifeſtly not a few places, wherin they haue ſwarued from the true text, and from the minde of the holy ghoſt. Notwithſtanding. I do gladly attribute ſo much to their antiquitie, and to the iudgement of the holy fathers, (who had them in greate reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) as may be attributed to them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt I will declare, how they diſsente from the Euangeliſtes (who doubtles were full of Gods ſpirit) and ſpecially in that point, whiche tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the myſterie of our faith.</p>
                     <p>Saint Mathew allegeth this place out of the old Teſtament. <hi>Vocaui fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium meum ex Aegipto</hi> I haue called my ſonne out of Egipt: &amp; he refer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto Chriſt.

They do not referre this prophecie vnto Chriſt, but to the people of Iſrael. They vtterly take away the miſterie from Chriſt, that they may ſaue the faith of their hiſtorie, which declareth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael were deliuered by the mighty hand of God, from the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage of Egipt.

The cauſe of this error was this. The conſonant letters in the Hebrue toung haue their ſignifications of the vowels or punctes, which are ſet vnderneth them. Now there be two wordes in the hebrue very much like both in writing and in ſound. Theſe be the wordes <hi>Chauod,</hi> whiche doth ſignifie <hi>Gloria,</hi> and <hi>Chaued,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>Eper,</hi> a liuer.

                        <p>Galatinus alleging many other of the Rabbines, their gloſes and their bookes, doth conclude, that this ſame <hi>Placenta,</hi> or cake ſhould be Meſsias him ſelfe, he bringeth in Rabbi Berachias in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Rabbi Iſaac, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this ſorte: As there was a firſt redemer, that is, Moſes: ſo there ſhalbe a laſt redemer. For as the firſt redemer cauſed Manna to deſcend, ſo ſhall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt redemer, that is Meſsias, ſhalbe a cake of wheat in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, accordyng to this ſaying of the Pſalme: <hi>Erit place<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta frume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti in terra</hi> that is (as Rabbi Ionathas expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it) there ſhalbe a ſacrifice of bread in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> top of the mountaines of the Churche, that is, a cake of bread ſhalbe a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice aboue the heads of the Prieſts which be in the Church. Thus ſaith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chaldey tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rabbi Ionathas,<note place="margin">Lib. 10. ca. 4.</note> as Galatinus allegeth. And (ſaith he) what is more rightly ſignified by the mountaines of the Church, then Prelates and Prieſts, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Scripture is fulfilled and verified, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they lift the body of Chriſt ouer their heades? O fourefolde, nay fourtie folde blindneſſe and ignorance, ſo to adde and diminiſhe the Scriptures, ſo to racke and rent the Scriptures from the true and naturall ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>This Pſalme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> type, is wholly writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the veritie and perfect acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhing therof, it is made and meant of Chriſt and his kingdome. It conteineth partly deprecations and prayers, partly the Propheticall deſcription of the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Some write, (and that verie wel) that this Pſalme was made of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, for the good ſucceſse of the kingdome of his ſonne Salomon, and that it was geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the people to be ſong. For after thend of the Pſalme, theſe wordes be added: here endeth the prayers of Dauid the ſonne of Iſay.</p>
                        <p>And it appeareth manifeſtly, that when Salomon his ſonne was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7195:279"/> and inueſted into the kingdome, that Dauid not long after ended his life, that it may be well beleued, this Pſalme to be the laſt prayers &amp; vowes of kyng Dauid, in whiche prayers he doth not onely deſire the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſse and felecitie of his ſonne Salomon, but alſo doth touche the felicitie, the power, the rightuouſnes, the ampleneſse and continuance of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Some verſes are applied both to Salomon, beyng a type, and alſo to Chriſt. ſome onely vnto Salomon, and ſome to his ſubiectes and there fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licitie, as the <hi>16.</hi> verſe, which is this: <hi>Sit pugillus frumenti in terram ſatus in caput montium, ſtrepitum edant, ſicut libanus fructus eius, &amp; floreant de ciuitate, ſicut herba terrae,</hi> that is, an handful of corne ſhalbe ſowen in the earth, euen in the toppe of the mountaines, and the fruite therof ſhall ſhake the trees of Libanon, and the children ſhall floriſhe out of the citie like the graſse of the erth. He praieth in this verſe for many things, firſt that there might be abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of corn, and that the earth might be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till. The wheat in that Region is both higher and greater in the ſtalk &amp; grain, than it is in other countries. He prayeth that it may be growen as high as the hills are, and that it might be ſo thicke, that it mighte make ſuch a noiſe when it is ſhake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the wind, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trees that grow vpon the mount Libanus do, when they are ſhaken with the wind.

                           </gap>. Secondly he prayeth and wiſheth, that the ſubiectes of his kingdome, might floriſhe and increaſe, both in number and in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of all things. And theſe things did happen to the kingdome of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as it maye be gathered out of hiſtories. But to drawe this verſe vnto a Cake aboue the Prieſtes head, as Galatinus, Lyranus, and other do, is an allegorie, not ſo farre fet, as fooliſhe. <hi>Haec</hi>

                        <p>To our purpoſe agayne.

                        <p>They do ſometime obſcure the whole text, when they had leauer vſe the darke Hebrue phraſe, then to ſpeake playnely in the Greke toung, into whiche toung, they tranſlated the text. An example. They read in the <hi>40.</hi> Pſalme: <hi>Holocauſtum &amp; pro peccato non poſtulaſti.</hi> In whiche wordes there is no ſenſe. But it is in the Hebrue, <hi>Holocauſtum &amp; pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non poſtulaſti</hi> VVhere this worde, <hi>Chataah</hi> is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for oblation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for ſinne, as <hi>Aſcham, Delictum,</hi> is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for an offering <hi>Pro delicto,</hi> as it is often read in Leuit. &amp; in the Prophet Eſay, where he ſayth: <hi>Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes comedunt peccata populi mei, hoc eſt, ſacrificia oblata pro peccatis

They do ſometime per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, as in the twentie of Leuiticus, they turne, <hi>Sponſam pro nuru,</hi> a wife, for a daughter in law.

                                 <am>

                        <p>Furthermore, that they know not the ſignification of ſome Hebrue wordes, this manifeſtly declareth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue left ſome hebrue wordes in the holy Scriptures vntranſlated, as in the booke of the kinges where they ſay: <gap reason="foreign">

For that word is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to the Hebrues, it ſignifieth a place broken, or ruinous. Our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare tranſlation doth wonderfully erre, expounding <hi>Bedec,</hi> for <hi>Sarta tec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta domus,</hi> whiche is an houſe ſubſtantially repaired, whiche hath no cleft nor hole in it, yea and whiche is ſo well reedified, that it might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and openly ſet and let to any y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would hyre it.

                        <p>But becauſe ye ſhall not thincke, that I haue them not in reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and do not well iudge of them. I will now ſhew what is to be commended and allowed in them. In certaine places they do better and more truly expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d both the wordes and ſentences, then the Latin interpreter. And they do oft times (omitting the words) exhibite a miſticall ſenſe. As in Exod: <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes ignorabat, quod cornuta eſſet facies eius.</hi> This is our vulgare tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: where it is in the Hebrue: <hi>Luxit cutis faciei ſuae.</hi> Now the <hi>.70.</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters for the other put theſe wordes, <hi>Quod aſpectus cutis vel coloris faciei ſuae erat glorificatus,</hi> that the ſight or ſkinne of his face was made glorious.</p>

And this tranſlation (as ſome thinke) is much better then the verſion of the Latin interpreter, who was decea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued by the likenes of, <hi>He,</hi> and <hi>Cheth.</hi> And yet I can not ſay properly, that he was deceiued.

But <hi>Shiloh,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten with <hi>Cheth,</hi> doth ſignifie <hi>Miſſus,</hi> whiche moued him ſo to turne it.

                        <p>Some learned men write, that <hi>Shiloh,</hi> with <hi>He,</hi> doth ſignifie <hi>Filiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and that <hi>He,</hi> is ſet in the ſteede of <hi>Vau,</hi> as ye would ſay, <hi>Filius eius.</hi> Other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine doe ſaye, that <hi>He,</hi> is not put for <hi>Vau,</hi> but that the word is written with <hi>He,</hi> by the minde of the holy ghoſt, to ſignifie Chriſt the ſonne of a woman.

                     <p>It is requiſite, that we vſe the ſame circumſpection in the booke of Iob, where diuerſe perſons are brought in ſpeaking. Furthermore, the Prophetes in their owne perſons oftentimes do reuele and make manifeſt the iudgements and councels of the wicked.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtles alſo likewiſe ofte tymes do ſet forth &amp; propoſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections of the aduerſaries.</p>

                     <p>Furthermore it is expedient to conſider, vnto whom the wordes are directed, whether to ſuperiours or els to inferiours, to all men or els to fewe men, to good men or els to euill men, to ſluggiſhemen, or els to quicke men, to enemyes, or els to frendes. For the Prophetes and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are wonte to temper their ſayinges and preathynges, for the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and conditions of thoſe that were aſsembled.</p>
                     <p>VVherupon ye ſe, that Chriſt ordereth his talke farre otherwiſe to the proud Phariſies, Scribes &amp; Lawyers, then to the lowly common ſort of people, or to the diſciples which were better inſtructed and taught.</p>
                     <p>Saint Paul writeth more ſharply to the Hebrues (whoſe ſluggiſhe myndes were to be ſtirred and excited by threatnynges and examples of the lawe) then to the Romanes or to the Corinthians, whiche were both more diligent, and alſo neuer before bound to the law.</p>
                     <p>He wrote otherwiſe alſo to the Galathians, beyng ſeduced and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſwarued to the Iewiſhe Religion: then to the Philippians or Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians, whiche were conſtant and ſtedfaſt in the ſounde doctrine whiche they had once receyued.

                     <p>In the new Teſtament are many thinges ſpoken whiche concerne all men, and alſo there are many thinges to be applied to fewe men, whiche vſe and enioye one certayne ſtate of life. As for example: Chriſt ſayth to

Saint Bernard writing vpon the Pſalm, ſemeth to touch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt very nerely in the prelacie and other eccleſiaſticall offices of the Churche. His wordes be theſe: <hi>Pro Epiſcopatibus &amp; Archidiaconatibus imprudenter hodie decertatur. &amp;c.</hi> that is. Nowe there is ſhameles ſtrife for Biſhopprickes and Archdeaconries, that the reuenues of the Church may be waſted vpon ſuperfluous and vayne vſes.

He openly declared, that in his time the reuelation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt might be gathered by the ſymonie, bying and ſellyng, ambition and riot of the eccleſiaſticall perſons. And here is to be noted that Saint Bernarde did acknowledge not onely that Antichriſt, whiche is agaynſt Chriſt, but alſo he whiche doth thruſt him ſelfe into the Churche in ſtede of Chriſt. So that Antichriſt may be called, both the aduerſarie and alſo the vicare of Chriſt. As he is not onely called <hi>Antiſtraticos,</hi> which ſetteth him ſelfe agaynſt the captaine of any hoſt, but alſo it is he whiche in ſtede of the captaine, intrudeth him ſelfe into the ſouldiours, and boſteth hym ſelfe to be captaine.

For Mahomet hath cauſed the Turkes to ſwarue from Chriſt. I am not ignoraunt that ſome of the olde diuines do hold, that Antichriſt ſhalbe borne in Babilon, and that theſe wordes, <hi>Fiat Dan coluber in via,</hi> are referred to Antichriſt as Saint Ambroſe, Theodoretus and other do expound that place, but howe aptly, I referre it to the iudgement of the learned reader.</p>

                  <p>Vnder Ieroboam king of Iſraell the greater part ouercame the better, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king depoſed &amp; put out of office the Leuits, the doctors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law and preachers of the ſincere veritie, and gaue vnlearned Prieſts and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours to the people.

Diſtincta eſt a poſterioribus libris excellentia Catholicae au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatis veteris ac noui Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti quae Apoſtolorum confirmata temporibus per ſucceſsiones Epiſcoporum &amp; propagines Eccleſiarum tanquam in ſede quadam ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limiter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtituta eſt, cui ſeruiat cuius fidelis &amp; pius intellectus, ibi ſi quid velut abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum mouerit, non licet dicere, author huius libri non tenuit veritatem, ſed aut calex mendoſus eſt, aut interpres errauit, aut tu non intelligis. &amp;c.</hi> The excellencie of the Catholique or Canonicall authoritie of tholde and new Teſtament, is diſtincte from the bookes of other that come after, whiche canonicall authoritie confirmed in the tyme of thapoſtles and by the ſucceſſion of Biſhops, &amp; by ſpredding abroade of the Churches, is conſtitute and ſet as it were the higheſt and chiefeſt ſeat, vnto whiche euery faithful and godly vnderſtandyng ought to ſerue and geue place. If any abſurde thyng be there moued it is not lawful to ſay, the authour of this boke did not hold the truth, but it is lawful to ſay, the boke is faultie or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> interpreter er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, or y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſt it not. In the works of the poſteritie (which ar conteyned in bokes innumerable) yet by no meanes ar they equal, or are to be compared to that moſt ſacred excellencie of the Canonical Scriptures, yea if in any of them ther be founde the ſame veritie, yet that authoritie is farre vnequall. Wherfore in them if any thing ſeeme to be diſſonant from the truth, becauſe they are not vnderſtand as they are ſpoken yet the reader hath free iudgement to approue that whiche pleaſeth hym, and to improue that whiche offendeth hym. This much S. Auſten.</p>

                     <p>Let vs examine the wordes of Saint Auſten a litle nerer and we ſhall finde theſe wordes of Saint Auſten to make rather agaynſt our aduerſaries then with them. Saint Auſten doth manifeſtly ſay that he will not beleue the Maniche or his word as the Scripture, becauſe the Scripture was diſtinct before the Apoſtles from all bookes, and was confirmed, they beyng aliue, and afterwarde receyued of all men in the Church without any contradiction. Therfore it is manifeſt that they falſifie the wordes of Saint Auſten, and do alledge them contrarie to their conſciences, for the worde not written, and the doctrines of men beſides the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Agaynſt the whiche Saint Auſten doth (as it were) <hi>Ex diametro</hi> fight. For he doth euidently forbidde any doctrine to be receiued in the Churche as the worde of God, whiche was not confirmed in the tyme of thapoſtles, and receyued in the Churche as the worde of God. And that this is the minde of Saint Auſten: Gerſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirmeth, and confuteth the impudencie of them whiche attribute power to the Churche to iudge of the Goſpell, and to make articles of the fayth without the Scriptures. His wordes be theſe. <hi>Ex iſtis deducitur quod maior fuit eccleſiae primi tiuae authoritas, quam nunc ſit Papae &amp; Epiſcoporum, &amp; quod non eſt in poteſtate concilii, aut eccleſiae mutare traditiones datas ab euangeliſtis. Et paulo poſt. Sicut qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam delirant, nec habent, quo ad hoc, quod eſt facere aliquod pure de fide parem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatis firmitatem. Licet enim ipſorum inſtitutiones in dubium vocare. Et hic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritur modus intelligendi illud Auguſtini. Eccleſiae non crederem niſi me compuliſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſet authoritas eccleſiae. Ibidem enim ſumit eccleſiam pro primitiua congregatione fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delium illorum qui Chriſtum audiuerunt, &amp; viderunt, &amp; eius teſtes fuerunt. &amp;c.</hi> Of theſe thinges it is deduced that the authoritie of the primatiue Church was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then the authoritie of the Pope is now and other Biſhops, and that it is not in the power of any councell or the Churche to alter or chaunge the traditions geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Euangeliſtes. And a litle after he ſaith: Nor they haue not (as ſome dote) the like firmneſſe of the authoritie concerning this, that is, to make any thing to be of faith pure, for it is lawful to call their inſtitutions to doubte. And here is opened the way to vnderſtande that ſaying of S. Auſten: I would not haue beleued the Goſpel, except the authoritie of the Churche had compelled me. For S. Auſten ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the church there for the primatiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation of thoſe faithful which heard Chriſt, ſawe him, and were witneſſes of him. This is the minde of Gerſon concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe wordes of Saint Auſten, <hi>Euangelio non crederem. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe wordes alſo may be vnderſtand after this maner: Sainct Auſten did not ſay, <hi>niſi mouiſſet authoritas eccleſiae.</hi> But doth ſignificantly ſay: <hi>niſi commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſſet,</hi> ſignifiyng the authoritie of the church by her ſelf not to haue bene ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but the two articles of the chriſtian faith, that is, the inſtincte of the holye ſpirite, and the ſtudie of the worde of God to moue the mindes of the electe to beleue.</p>
                     <p>Nor this argument is anie thinge worth. Sainct Auſten would not haue beleued the goſpel except he had ben moued of the church, <hi>Ergo</hi> the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the church beareth rule ouer the ſcripture. I wil make you the like forme of arguments.</p>
                     <p>Iohn came to beare teſtimonie of the light Chriſt, that all might beleue by hym. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Iohn is to be preferred before Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Again, many of the Samaritanes beleued in Chriſt, through the wordes of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Samaria. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the woman of Samaria is to be preferred before Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Again, let the women be ſubiect to their huſbands that they whiche beleue not the word, might he won without the worde by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation of women. <hi>Ergo</hi> the conuerſation of women is better then the worde.</p>
                     <p>What fonde man, what dolte, or what aſſe would thus argue or reaſon after this maner? Truly none excepte he were deſtitute of the common ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>To make Auſtenes words plaine, you ſhall note that S. Auſten had muche to do with the Manichies, who without all controuerſie would haue credit to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7195:293"/> vnto them, and yet did not ſhew the veritie which they boaſted and promiſed to haue. And alſo that they might purchaſe faith vnto their maiſter Maniche they made a pretence and alledged the goſpel. Nowe S. Auſten demaundeth of them what they would do if they chaunced vpon ſuch a man which beleued not the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and aſketh them with what kinde of perſuaſion they woulde leade him vnto their ſentence. And afterward S. Auſten doth ſay: I would not haue beleued the goſpel, except the autoritie of the church had compelled me: ſignifieng, that when he was an alien from the fayth, he could no otherwiſe bee induced to embrace the goſpell, or the infallible veritie of God, excepte he had bene conuinced by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the church. And what maruel is it, if one not yet knowing Chriſt, haue reſpect of men? Therfore S. Auſten dothe not in this place teache that the faith of the godly is founded vpon the authoritie of the church, nor doth vnderſtande the certaintie of the goſpel to depend therof, but doth ſhew, <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell would be moſt vncertayne to the infidels that they might be wonne to Chriſt by it, except the authoritie of the church do impell them, ſo that the church is (as it were) <hi>Iſagoge,</hi> by the which we be prepared vnto fayth.</p>

                     <p>Theſe wordes of Tertullian do fight for the authoritie of the Scriptures, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt al doctrines geuen after, and againſt the worde not written: for there was diſputation of the doctrine of the Manichies to be receyued for the Scripture and the worde of God: which Cerdon, Marcion and Praxeas did contend, with whom Tertullian had much to do. But he aunſwereth, he would not ſtand to their preſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>criptions (we may call them well enough proſcriptions) vnles they would admit them whole Scripture receiued of the Church, and would acknowledge the autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie of the church, teſtifieng of the ſcriptures. For the church is as <hi>teſtis</hi> &amp; witnes of the doctrine of the apoſtles, which the apoſtles would to be firme and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.

                     <p>Saint Cypriane hath a ſhort ſentence, but yet ſure and firme of all ſuch tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Non hominum conſuetudinem, ſed dei veritatem ſequendam eſſe, nec curan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid homines ante nos ſenſerint, ſed quid Chriſtus ante omnes mandauerit.</hi> We muſt not folow (ſaith he) the cuſtome of men, but the veritie of God, nor we ought to regarde what men haue iudged before, but what Chriſt hath commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not onely forbidden by the Scriptures for man to marrie his brothers wife, but alſo by the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and learned fathers, and by certaine generall councels. Tertullian the moſt eldeſt writer of al that wer ſince the time of the apoſtles, doth writ that this Leuiticall forbidding that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould not marrie his brothers wife, was brought in, taught, and ordeined, ſpecially and by name, euen of Christ him ſelfe and his apostles, becauſe that all the whole Churche and company of Christes faith ſhould obſerue and kepe it with all reuerence.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe (ſaith he) that certain perſons ſomtimes do ſay that they haue nothing to do with Moſes law, which Christ doubtles did not take away, but fulfilled and made it perfect, do ſometime take thoſe things of the law that liketh them and make for their purpoſe. Plainly we alſo ſe this that the law is departed and gone as touching this point: that according to the minde and ſaying of the apostles, the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the law which our fathers wer not able to beare, be vtterly ceaſsed and taken away. But as for thoſe things that pertaine to iuſtice and vertue do remaine whole, not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, but alſo amplified and encreaſed, ſo that our iustice and goodnes which be Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, ſhould be much greater and perfecter then the iuſtice of the Scribes and phariſies, and be ſuch iuſtice as a very iuſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to haue. And our chaſtitie likewiſe ſhould excell and paſse theirs, and in no point be leſse then theirs. Now becauſe it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes law, that a man ſhould marry his brothers wife, that is departed with out children, becauſe he ſhould ſtirre vp ſede, or get iſſue to his brother. And becauſe this thing may happen oftentimes to one perſon, as that one woman may be married to ſix or vij. brethren one after another, for lack of iſsue by the former brother according to the ſuttle queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sadu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces in the Goſpel: therfore ſome do thinke that the oftennes of Mariage is promiſed alſo in other caſes. But theſe men ſhould haue vnderſtand firſt of all the reaſon and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of this precept, and ſo they ſhould haue knowne that this reaſon is now ceaſſed, and is one of the things which be now voide and of no ſtrength nor authoritie. For a man was bound of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie to marrie the wife of his brother, which was departed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7195:294"/> Firſt becauſe that as yet that old bleſsing of God (increaſe you and multiplie) ought to runne forth and continue. Second, becauſe the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were puniſhed for the fathers faultes. Thirdly becauſe the drie and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren perſons wer had for defamed perſons. Therfore, ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was made that they ſhould haue iſsue by other of their kinne, as ye would ſay by a proctour, and begotten after the death of the father: becauſe that they which wer departed without iſsue, not by the fault of nature and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of death, ſhould not therfore be iudged accurſed and vnhappy. But now the bleſsyng of increaſing and multiplieng bodily and carnally is ceaſſed, becauſe the world is at an end. For the Apoſtle induceth and counceleth vs ſaying: There is no more but that they alſo which haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſhould be, as if they had none, becauſe the time is ſhort. And agayne. The ſoure grape that our fathers did eate, that is, the ſinne that they did eate, doth no more ſtoniſh or ſet on edge the teeth of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſhall dye for his owne ſinne. And moreouer the barren now be not onely without infamie and rebuke, but alſo haue deſerued fauour and thanckes of God, beyng inuited and admitted into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore now this law that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſuccede into his brothers mariage, or that he ſhould mary his brothers wife, is now vtterly dead &amp; buried, and the contrarie of this law taketh place, that a man ſhoulde not ſuccede into his brothers Mariage, nor marrye his brothers wife. And by this (as is ſaid before) that law which is ceaſſed &amp; is no more of ſtrength, becauſe the reaſon of it is ceaſsed or taken away, cannot be a conuenient proofe for another thing. This much Tertullian.</p>
                  <p>Chriſoſtome doth plainly an ſtifly holde that fable and tale that the Saduces made vpon the woman, that they ſaid was maried to ſeuen bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, to be but a fanſie and thinge feigned &amp; imagined. For the Iewes (ſaith he) be ſuch men, that we ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now at this time to be mighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afraide to marrie with their brothers wiues, becauſe as ye would ſay, they thincke ſurely ther ſhould ſome miſchief come of it. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the law ſhould conſtraine and binde them to marrie their brothers wiues, yet for all that we ſee them many times litle regarde it, and make light of it, and not to do it.</p>
                  <p>Iſichius ſaith: it is in very dede vncomly and as nigh to the life of brute beaſts as can be, for a man to be married and to meddle with his brothers wife, or with any of his kinſmens wiues, namely them that be nighe of bloud. Vvherfore God commaundeth and decreeth that he which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth of this faſhion, ſhall die without children. Doubles becauſe that he miſuſing himſelf doth marre and confound, and vtterly diſorder the law of bringyng forth children. Again Iſichius ſaith thus. Theſe thinges be not ſpoken of onely to the Iewes, which becauſe they be circumciſed and
<pb facs="tcp:7195:295"/> haue Moſes law, thincke them ſelues alone from all other nations, but they be ſpoken to euerie man, woman, and child, which entend to ſerue God. Saincte Auguſtine writinge againſte Fauſtus, ſaith thus. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine lawes of the booke of the olde Teſtamente wee doo not keepe now a dayes, becauſe ſuch laws were made onely to be a ſhadow of things to come. And thoſe lawes though they were conuenient and fitte to be commaunded and ſuffred for that people, and for that time, yet we now a dayes that be chriſtian people, ought not to kepe them bodily, or as the bare letter and wordes do ſpeake, but we muſt conſider what they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, and we be taught by the Apoſtles owne writings, that we muſt kepe ſuch lawes ſpiritually, not corporally. For when we read any ſuch thing in the inſtrument of the old Teſtament, which in the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be not commaunded to kepe, or vtterly forbid to kepe them, we must not rebuke it, but we must ſeke out the ghostly meanyng of it: for in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we do no more obſerue it, that proueth not that it is damned &amp; in no wiſe to be receiued, but that it is fulfilled. And therfore this ſame ſelfe thing that Fauſtus, becauſe he doth not vnderstand it, hath layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Chriſtian men, as a crime and grieuous offence: ſerueth for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng els in the world, but onely to ſhewe miſtically vnder a figure and cloud, a ſpirituall purpoſe, and it is this: that euery preacher of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is bounde ſo to labour in the Goſpell that he ſtirre vp ſede to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers departed, that is, to Chryſte, whyche died for vs. And the ſeede that ſhalbe ſtirred vp, muſt haue the name of the brother that is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Vvherfore we be called Chriſtians, and therfore without doubt, we now be bounde to fulfill and kepe this law, not carnally by bodily genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the olde meanyng and taking of it, but ſpiritually and by ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generation, and after the true vnderſtandyng. And for this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint Paul fulfilleth this law ſpiritually, where he is angry with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he ſayth hym ſelf to haue engendred and gotten through the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and the worde of God to Christ Ieſus, his brother, and not to hym ſelfe nor to any other man. And therfore doth ſharpely blame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them whiche would be called Paulius or Paules men. Vvhat (ſayth he) was Paule crucified for you? or were you Baptized in the name of Paule? As if he had ſayd, I begat you to my brother whiche is dead, that is, to Chriſt. Be you called therfore Chriſtians, Chriſtes men, not Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius or Paules men. Agayne Saint Auguſtine in his booke of queſtions vpon the Leuiticall, and in that worke alſo that he named the mirrour, ſayth that this forbode that a man ſhould not marry his brothers wyfe, and all other thinges that be forbid in the xviii. chaptre of Leuiticus, we be bound without doubt to kepe them now in the tyme of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and law of the Goſpell, when the obſeruaunce and kepyng of the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7195:295"/> olde ſhadowes and bodily or outward tokens are taken awaye. For what ſoeuer thyng (as he ſayth in an other place) doth helpe and ſerue for good manners and vertue, lyke as they wer not ordeined to betoken any thing, but to ſhewe vs how we muſt lyue: ſo they ought not by any interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or vnderſtandyng be applied to any ſignifieng or tokenyng, as if they were but ſignes and tokens of thyngs. But as many as be of Chriſtes Religion or beliefe, be bounde of neceſsitie to kepe them euer, ſo as they be ſpoken. And in another place he alſo ſayth. Although in tymes paſt men marryed their ſiſters, yet that thyng was done becauſe neceſsitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled men to it, for becauſe then wer ſo few people. But this thyng was not ſo olde nor at any tyme ſo neceſſarie, but it is now as damnable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Religion forbiddeth it: for it ought to be done than when it might, becauſe that by marrieng of ſiſters there myght be plentie of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſo that by proceſſe they myght take wiues whiche ſhould not be their ſiſters. But afterwarde once that this neceſsitie ceaſsed, and that there wer women enough, this thyng ought not onely to be vndone, but alſo if it were done, it ſhould be a crime not to be ſpoken. For I wote not howe (ſayth hee) there is amonge all the pointes of mans ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes one certayne naturall and commendable poynte whiche is this, that to whatſoeuer woman we be bounde to doo honour with reuerence and ſhamefaſtnes, our carnall luſte, yea though it be for generation, yet becauſe it is carnall luſt, we refrayne it from that woman ſpecially, conſideryng that we do ſee marryed folke, namely ſuch as haue ſhame and honeſty, to be aſhamed of ſuch lust.</p>
                  <p>And in the councell of Agathen it is ordeined in this manner. VVe reſerue vtterlie no manner of forgeuenes nor pardon nor diſpenſation for inceſte in Mariages, but we will in any wyſe that they be puniſhed, excepte onely they heale their adulterie by departyng thone from tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for as for inceſtuous perſonnes, we iudge them not worthy to haue any name of Mariage, ſeyng it is a deadly thyng, euen to make any token or mention of ſuch perſonnes. And we iudge them to be inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whiche by carnall medlyng haue defiled their brothers widowe, which was in manner his ſiſter before, or he that hath taken to wife his ſister germane, and he that hath married his ſtepmother. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>All theſe perſonnes we doubte not but they haue beene before tyme and by this our conſtitution be inceſtuous perſonnes. And we commaunde that they praye and abyde among them that be yet vnchristened and but onely learners of the Christian fayth, and not to come amonge Chriſtian folke vntill they haue ſufficiently repented them ſelfe and amended that they haue miſdone. Furthermore in the councel of Neoceſar, and in the Synod of Gregorie the yonger it was decreed according to the words
<pb facs="tcp:7195:296"/> of God, that a woman which had bene marryed to two brethren ſhould be put backe from communion and from receyuing the Sacrament vntil ſhe dye. And a man that had marryed his brothers wife ſhould be an ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theme. In the whiche Synode all together aunſwered, an anatheme be he, that is as much to ſay, as damnable to euerlastyng death.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, where VVickliff did holde that the prohibitions of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie written in the Leuiticall law, were onely Iudaicall precepts of Moſes, and therefore the cauſes of diuorce brought in by the meane of kindred and affinitie, to be onely the ordinaunce of man, his ſentence was condemned as hereticall in the great conuocation whiche was had firſt at London, and laſt at Oxford.</p>

               <p>I will repaire forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the text of the firſte Epiſtle of ſainct Peter, whiche beginneth thus. <hi>Petrus Apoſtolus Ieſu Chriſti. &amp;c.</hi> Peter an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Ieſus Chriſte, to the ſtraungers that dwell here and there, throughout <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Galatia, Capadotia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> electe accordyng to the fore knowlege of God the father, vnto ſanctificacion of the ſpirite, through obedience and ſprincklyng of the blood of Ieſus Chriſte: grace and peace bée multiplied vnto you.</p>
               <p>In this Epiſtle, I note three thinges.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Quibus ſit ſcripta,</hi> To whom it was written,</p>

               <p>Concernyng the firſte. <hi>Lyranus</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> in his commentarie doe thinke, that this Epiſtle was written vnto theim, whiche were conuerted from the Heatheneſſe religion, vnto the Lawe of Moſes, whom we call in Greke <gap reason="foreign">

For it is not in the Greke: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: that is, to the ſtraungers, whiche ſtraungers were Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, to whom Peter was appointed to be an Apoſtle. And <gap reason="foreign">

But the turmoiles and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the warres, vnder the kynges of the Aſſirians, of the Babilonians, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:297"/> and of the Macedonians, did diſperſe and ſcatter abroade the Iewes, ſome to this place, and ſome to that place.</p>
               <p>Nor it foloweth, that Peter preached the Goſpell before vnto theim, becauſe he ſente this Epiſtle vnto theim. For Paule writeth an Epiſtle vnto the Romaines, whom notwithſtandyng <hi>Iunias</hi> and <hi>Andronicus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Iunias.</note> did firſte of all other inſtitute in chriſtian religion. So Peter doeth write here to theim that were in <hi>Galatia,</hi> and in the leſſe <hi>Aſia:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Andronicꝰ.</note> yet notwithſtandyng, thei were firſt inſtructed in the faithe by Paule. In fine, Peter doeth teſtifie to al theſe in his Epiſtle, the faith weiche thei receiued, whether it were of Paule, or of Peter of hymſelf, or of any other, to be the true faithe of a true chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Theſe wordes of the texte before rehearſed, are nothyng els, but, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, the inſcripcion or title, whiche Paule vſeth in the beginning of all his writinges, ſauyng in the Epiſtle to the Hebrues.</p>
               <p>Thus moche for the firſt note, that is, to whom this Epiſtle was written.</p>
               <p>Now to the ſeconde note, I will ſhewe you what maner of manne he was that wrote it: and firſt I will touche his proper name.</p>
               <p>The proper name of Peter was <hi>Simon,</hi> whiche ſignifieth in the Hebrue <hi>audiens, vel, obediens,</hi> hearyng or obeiyng: It cometh of the radicall <hi>Shamagh</hi> or <hi>Shamah,</hi> whiche ſignifieth <hi>audire, parare, exaudire, obtemporare,</hi> that is, to heare or obeye.</p>
               <p>He tooke this name <hi>Cephas</hi> (whiche is a Syrian woorde) of Chriſte, who gaue it vnto hym: whiche woorde in Greke is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and dooeth ſignifie in Latine a rocke, or a ſtone. For as rockes and harde ſtones are wonte to be laied in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of any buildyng: ſo the faithe of Peter, and of the whole churche, doeth ſtaie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſte, the firme and vnmouable rocke, vpon whom the whole churche is builded.</p>
               <p>I maruaile that the Papiſtes be not aſhamed, to tranſlate this woorde <hi>Cephas,</hi> to ſignifie <hi>caput,</hi> a hedde. Euery blinde Aſſe maie perceiue moche diffrence betwene <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Greke betokeneth in deede, an hedde: but <hi>Cepha</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth a ſtone, whiche is a Caldei woorde. Chriſt did not ſaie, <hi>tu vocaberis</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> whiche ſignifieth in Hebrue properlie a rocke. And by a metapher, it ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth alſo a tower, or a caſtle.</p>
               <p>In deede if Chriſt had vſed this Hebrue woorde, thei might haue had ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (at the leaſt apparantlie) to haue named Peter the chief tower, or the chief hedde. But for aſmoche as Chriſte vſed the Caldei woorde <hi>(Cephas)</hi> whiche alwaies doeth ſignifie a rocke, or a ſtone, nor is tranſlated to any other ſignificacion, thei can take no handfaſte by this name,<note place="margin">3. Soch lippes</note> to make Peter hedde of the churche. But as the common Prouerbe is, <hi>Similes habent labra lactucas.</hi> Soche lippes, ſoche Lettuſe: ſoche bokes ſoche bookemen. Thei reade this corrupte gloſe, in a certain ſpurious booke, goyng in the name of <hi>Anacletus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this woorde <hi>Cephas</hi> it appereth, that the Hebrue toung was not the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> toungue vnto the Iewes, in the tyme of Chriſte, but rather the Caldean or Syrian toungue, whiche bothe be verie nere vnto the Hebrue toungue.</p>
               <p>Thus moche for the name. And now to the perſone.</p>
               <p>He was born in a toune called <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> ſituate by the ſea ſide of Galile. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name was Ihon, and therefore he was called <hi>Simon Bariona,</hi> that is, <hi>Simon</hi> the ſonne of Ihon, for ſo the Iewes called their children, as <hi>Bar Ptolomei,</hi> the ſonne of Ptolomie. He had a brother named Andrewe, who bothe gatte their liuynges by fiſſhing in the ſea. And by this it appereth, that in his youth he was not learned, and that he would haue continued a fiſſher, ſo longe as he liued, if he had not been after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward called of Chriſte to an higher funccion and office.</p>
               <p>Some write that he was a citezen of <hi>Capernaum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicephorus</hi> deſcribeth the ſtature and forme of his perſonage. Peter (ſaieth he) was no groſſe man, but ſomewhat high and tall. He was of a pale and whitelie face.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7195:297"/> He was of a pale and whitelie face. The heere of his hedde and his bearde, wer cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and thicke. He had a longe noſe, not copped in the middes, but preſte doune and ſomewhat flatte. He was the hearer and diſciple of Ihon the Baptiſte, and brought to Chriſt by his brother Androwe. And when Chriſte ſawe hym, he ſaied vnto hym. Thou art Simon the ſonne of Ihon, thou ſhalt be called <hi>Cephas.</hi>

               <p>It appereth by Mathewe and by Luke, that he was a maried manne, and had a wife: for thei write that Chriſt healed Peters wiues mother of a feuer in <hi>Capernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe Paule recordeth, that Peter did leade about his wife with hym.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> alſo declareth, that Clement writeth,<note place="margin">4. Leade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute. Stroma. libri. 7.</note> Peter and Philip to haue geuen them ſelues to the procreacion of children.</p>
               <p>And Clement writeth, that when Peter ſawe his wife leade to death, beyng glad of that her callyng, he exhortyng and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortyng her, did call her by her proper name, ſaiyng: <hi>Heus tu, memento domini:</hi> O wife, remember the Lorde.</p>

               <p>He walked on the ſea. He confeſſed Chriſte to be the ſonne of the liuyng God.<note place="margin">Math. 14. and .16.</note> He aſcended with Chriſt into the mount, where he heard Elias and Moyſes talke with Chriſte.

               <p>After the reſurreccion, he was commaunded of Chriſt, to feede his ſhepe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded three tymes, whether he loued Chriſte or no. After the aſcencion he choſe Matthias, into the nomber of the twelue Apoſtles, in the ſtede of Iudas the traitour.

               </p>
               <p>Certaine learned menne call into controuerſie, where Peter ſuffered death, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Rome or no. But ſome holde, that Peter neuer came to Rome. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, Ireneus, Tertullian, Dioniſius and Lactantius plainlie affirme, that Peter and Paule preached at Rome.

But he came not to Rome in that iourney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Origenes</hi> ſaieth, that Peter was conſtituted and placed at Rome, about the ende of his life, and there martired.</p>
               <p>Many dooe affirme, that Peter came to Rome in the tyme of <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſome ſaie in the ſeconde yere, ſome in the thirde, and ſome in the fowerth: and that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and preached there .xxv. yeres.

               <p>But if wee conferre more nerelie and more diligentlie theſe thynges, with thoſe thynges whiche Paule wrote to the Galathians, we ſhall perceiue this computacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Euſebius to be falſe. For there Paule reherſeth, that in the fowertenth yere after his conuerſion, he aſcended to Hieruſalem, and that he founde there, Peter Ihon and Iames, and this was the ſixte yere of <hi>Claudius.</hi> Yea, Peter was yet at Hieruſalem, in the nineth yere of the reigne of <hi>Claudius.</hi> Nor it is like that Peter came to Rome, as long as <hi>Claudius</hi> liued, but that he came to Rome after the death of <hi>Claudius,</hi> when <hi>Nero</hi> had reigned certaine yeres, vnder whom he was ſlaine and martyred. The maner of his death <hi>Egeſippus</hi> deſcribeth after this maner.</p>
               <p>When a precept &amp; commaundement was geuen out by <hi>Nero,</hi> to apprehend Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he was deſired to go to ſome other place. He refuſed ſaiyng, he would not doe it, leaſte he ſhould ſeme to depart for feare of death. It is a good thyng, ſaieth he, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death for Chriſte, whiche offred hymſelf to death for all menne, and ſaied that it ſhould not be death, but immortalitie. It ſemed to hym an vnworthie thyng, that he ſhould aduoide &amp; flie from ſuffryng death of his bodie, whiche by his doctrine had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced many to offer them ſelues to death for Chriſt. He ſaid it was his duetie (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the worde of the lorde) that he ſhould alſo geue glorie and honour to God in ſuffring death: but the people praied hym with teares, that he would not leaue them (through his death) doubtyng and waueryng emong the ſtormes of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Now Peter béeyng ouercome with their wepyng, promiſed, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of the citée. And the nexte night, when he had ſaluted the brethren, and had praied, he marched forwarde alone in his iourney: when he came to the gate of the citée, he ſawe Chriſt commyng toward hym, and fallyng doune, ſaied, Lorde, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goeſt thou? Chriſte ſaied to hym, I come again to Rome to bee crucified, Peter vnderſtoode, that it was ſpoken of his owne paſſion and death, becauſe Chriſte ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſuffer in it, whiche ſuffereth in euery of his members, not with the grief of the bodie, but with a certain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion of mercie, or els with the ſolemnizacion of his glorie. He retournyng went into the citee againe, and there was taken of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutours, and adiudged to be hanged: but he requeſted that he might be put vpon the croſſe, with his feete tourned vpwarde, becauſe he was vnworthie to bee crucified in ſoche ſorte, as the ſonne of God ſuffered, whiche he obteined, and ſo died.

               <p>In the firſte Epiſtle he intreateth and diſcuſſeth thrée ſpeciall places, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingleth theim together, by ſondrie waies and meanes. For firſte, he exhorteth his countremen, to perſeuer conſtantlie in the true knowledge and faithe of Chriſt our ſauiour.

Notwithſtandyng, becauſe many thought it to be profitable, it is vſed with other ſcriptures.

That I maie not ſéeme tedious vnto you, I will goe forwarde in the texte, to the nexte worde, whiche is, <hi>Apoſtolus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petrus Apoſtolus:</hi> Peter the Apoſtle. He calleth hymſelf an Apoſtle, whiche ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth a Legate, or Embaſſadour, whiche dooeth his meſſage by mouthe, whiche he hath receiued in commaundemente.

And here note, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer dooe preache the doctrines of men, are excluded from the function of Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: for he is the Legate of Chriſte, who doeth that, whiche Chriſte hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. If he preache any other thing, he is not Chriſtes Legate, nor is to be heard.</p>
               <p>Tertullian verie learnedlie &amp; godlie agréeth to this, writyng after this maner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">De preſcri. hereticoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>
                  <hi>Nobis vero nihil ex noſtro arbitrio indulgere licet, ſed nec eligere quod aliquis de arbitrio ſuo induxerit. Apoſtolos domini habemus authores, qui nec ipſi quicquam de ſuo arbitrio quod inducerent elegerunt ſed acceptam a Chriſto diſciplinam fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nationibus aſsignauerunt.</hi> That is. It is not lawfull for vs to phantaſie or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour any thyng of our owne arbitrement, nor to chuſe that, whiche any manne hath brought of his owne will. Wee haue the Apoſtles of the Lorde, for preſidentes and aucthoritees, whiche did not chuſe any thyng, that thei might bryng in, by their own arbitremente and will, but that diſcipline, whiche thei receiued of Chriſte, thei did faithfullie aſſigne and contribute to other nacions.</p>
               <p>Note here alſo, that none taketh vpon hym, to be a Legate or Ambaſſadour, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he bee aſſigned and appoincted thereunto. So none ought to vſurpe the office of the Legate of Chriſte, vnles he be called thereto (as Peter was.) And becauſe I haue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7195:300"/> incidentlie made mencion of callyng, I will declare vnto you what callyng in this reſpecte is, and how many kindes of callyng there be.</p>
               <p>Callyng to the miniſterie, is nothyng els but a lawfull conſtitucion, of a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niente and mete miniſter. It maie bee alſo called an orderyng or election: albeit the one woorde is taken more largelie then the other. Election goeth before by nature, for whom wee chuſe, theim wee call. Ordinaunce comprehendeth bothe. There are commonlie nombred fower kindes of callynges, whereof the twoo firſte are legitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and the twoo later are illegitimate and vnlawfull. The firſte kinde of callyng is that, whereby miniſters are called, neither of men, nor by man, but by God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Like as Eſaie the Prophete, and the Apoſtle Paule are reade to be called. This callyng for the moſte parte, is confirmed by ſignes and miracles, and is called a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and ſecrete callyng.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde kinde of callyng is doen of God, but by the ordinaunce of menne. In whiche kinde ſainct Mathie, Luke and Timothie are readde to bee ordeined and made miniſters of the Churche. This kinde is in this tyme ordinarie, publique, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and vulgare, in whiche God calleth, geuyng neceſſarie giftes to the miniſters, and appoinctyng lawes to thoſe that doe electe and chuſe theim, who folowyng and obſeruyng theſe lawes, doe ordinarie chuſe him, whom thei doe coniecture to be firſt called of God, by certaine preſidentes and tokens. By ſignes I vnderſtande giftes neceſſarie for miniſters.</p>
               <p>The thirde kinde of callyng, cometh of menne, but not of God, as when any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie manne is ordered, for fauour and for rewardes. In this behalfe thei that are ordered doe offende God, aſwell as thei that order theim. Thei that are ordered doe offende, when aſpiryng to the miniſterie, either thei doe not vnderſtande, or wil not vnderſtande, them ſelues to be vnmete, as perſones deſtitute of neceſſarie giftes. Or els thei offende God, when thei bee inſtructed enough, in the knowlege of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet thei come not to the office for a right ende or waie: foraſmoche as thei dooe not reſpecte the glorie of God, but haue a regarde to their owne priuate lucre. For there is required of them that be ordered, a teſtimonie of their owne conſciences, and a ſecrete callyng, by the whiche we doe aſſuredlie knowe our ſelues to be ſtirred and moued of God to take the function, not through ambicion, not through couetouſnes, not to liue eaſilie and idlelie, nor by any other corrupte affeccion, but by a pure feare and loue of God, and to the edifiyng of the Churche of God. Of whiche teſtimonie ſainct Paule writeth verie eligantlie, and moſte godlie to the Theſſalonians. The teſtimonie alſo of other that bée learned, and well experte in thynges, is required to the orderyng of them. For we all dooe ſtande in our owne conceites, and dooe iudge our ſelues worthie, to whom the gouernaunce of the Churche maie bee committed, but we deceiue our ſelues moſte ſhamefullie.</p>
               <p>Thei alſo whiche doe order miniſters, doe offend God, when thei doe not reſpect what God by his holie lawes, would haue to bee doen, and what the condicion and ſtate of the Churche requireth to be doen: but doe reſpecte the commoditie and profite of hym that is ordered, therefore many tymes vnworthie miniſters are ordered: or els thei that be vnlearned, and not of a ſincere life: or els thei that be learned enough but not of verie good integritie of life: or els thei that bée ſimple and good Chriſtians but yet are euill and not wiſe paſtours, whiche all are induced and brought to the miniſterie by fauour, oe els by giftes. Wherefore thei prouoke the greate wrathe of God vpon them, and doe make them ſelues partakers of al their ſynnes, whom thei order miniſters.</p>
               <p>The olde writers dooe calle this iniquitie, Simonie,<note place="margin">Simonie.</note> to bee puniſhed not onelie with continuall reproche, but alſo with eternall death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anthenins</hi> the Emperour, writyng to <hi>Armaſius,</hi> ſaieth thus. Let no man buye the office of Prieſthoode with money. Let it be eſtemed how moche euery prieſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth, not how moche he is able to geue. Let the prophane burnyng deſire of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes ceaſſe from the altars.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7195:301"/>
               <p>Let ſo chaſte and humble a prelate bée elected in our tyme, that to what place ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he ſhall come vnto, he maie purifie all thynges, with the integritie of his own life. And let hym be ordered <hi>(non precio, ſed precibus)</hi> not by price, but by praiers.</p>
               <p>Thus moche ſaieth the Emperour Anthenius. Who (if he ſhould in theſe daies come to Rome) he would thinke that he came into a ſtraunge worlde, yea, into the marte of Simon, not of Simon Peter, but of Simon Magus.</p>
               <p>The fourth kinde of callyng is that, wherein euery manne by his owne priuate arbitremente,<note place="margin">Ieremie. 23.</note> doeth intrude hym ſelf into the miniſterie, not beyng ordeined of God neither by man. Of theſe menne did the Lorde ſpeake by Ieremie, ſaiyng. <hi>Ipſi curre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant &amp; ego non mittebam eos.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ciprianus ad Antonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </note> Thei did runne, and I did not ſende them. Ciprian calleth them ſciſmatikes, whiche doe vſurpe and take to theim ſelues a prieſthoode, or biſhopricke, no man geuyng it to them. And this kinde of callyng is called vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie a callyng.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is manifeſt, that there is no nede of a publique &amp; lawfull callyng of miniſters in the church. For many cauſes, but chifly alſo for theſe cauſes, that is, that thinſtitucion &amp; ordinaunce of God be not neglected. And that eccleſiaſtical diſcipline be reteined. And that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maie know in the church, who be miniſters, &amp; who not.</p>
               <p>Albeit, the Apoſtle Paule at the beginning, was ſent not of men, nor by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but onelie of God, yea, by the commaundement of the holie ghoſt, he was ſeparate with Barnabas,<note place="margin">Actes. 13.</note> from the Churche of Antioche, to preache and to miniſter the woorde of God to the Gentiles. In like maner many haue been called, and ſent of God, whom notwithſtandyng it behoued to be ordeined by men.<note place="margin">Hebreo. 5.</note> For Paule ſaieth. <hi>Nemo hoc ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi honoris vſurpat, ſed qui vocatur a deo ſicuti Aaron.</hi> No manne taketh vnto hym this honour, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.

Therefore in Moiſes, the Lawe, in Helias, the Prophetes wer repreſented. For although Helias lefte nothyng written behind hym, yet he

For the Lorde would theim (although thei were dedde, and had runne the courſe of their vocacion) to eſtabliſhe againe with their owne voyces that thyng, whiche thei taught in their life tyme.</p>
                        <p>Other learned men doe bryng other reaſons and cauſes, why Moiſes and Helias appered, rather then other.</p>
                        <p>The firſt reaſon is (ſaie thei) becauſe the people ſaied, that Chriſte, was Helias, or Hieremie, or one of the Prophetes, he brought therfore with him the chief of the Prophetes, that the difference of the ſeruauntes and maiſter might be diſcerned and knowen.</p>
                        <p>The ſeconde reaſon is. Becauſe the Iewes continually accuſed Ieſus, as a tranſgreſſour of the Lawe, and as a blaſphemour, vſurpyng to hym ſelf the glory of God. But that he might ſhewe hym ſelf to bee giltleſſe, from bothe the accuſacions, he bryngeth forthe them, whiche excelled bothe in the lawe and in propheciyng. For Moiſes gaue the Lawe, and Helias was very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the glory of God.</p>
                        <p>The thirde reaſon is, that thei might knowe, that Chriſt had power ouer
<pb facs="tcp:7195:303"/> death and life, and therefore he brought Moiſes, whiche died naturally, and Helias, whiche yet had ſuffred no corporall death.</p>
                        <p>The fourth reaſon, the Euangeliſte hymſelf declareth, that is, to ſhewe the glory of the croſſe of Chriſte,<note place="margin">Luke.</note> and to mitigate the feare of death. For thei did ſpeake (as an other Euangeliſte declareth) of Chriſtes departyng, which he ſhould accompliſhe at Hieruſalem. VVhereupon he bryngeth forthe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche ſet them ſelues forward to death, for thoſe whiche pleaſed God, and for the faithfull people: for, bothe of theim offred them ſelues voluntarilie to tyrauntes, Moiſes to Pharao, and Helias to Achab.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Hilarius.</note>The fifte reaſon is, becauſe Chriſte would haue the diſciples to bee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meke as Moiſes was, and feruent and zelous, as Helias was.</p>

                     <p>Aegeſippus recordeth the like ſaiyng, Peter and Paule were at Rome, who by the renoume of their woorkes, cauſed Nero to be their enemie, who was inueghled with the falſe entiſement of Simon Magus, who by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke promiſed Nero, that he would helpe hym in obteinyng againſt any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie the victorie, to ſubdue any nacion, and promiſed hym long life. And Nero, whiche did not duely examine thynges, credited hym to moche. To be ſhort, Magus was in the chiefeſte ſeate of amitie and frendſhip with hym. And albeit he had proued the power of Peter in other partes to bee greate, notwithſtandyng commyng to Rome before Peter, was bolde to boaſt, that he raiſed vp againe the dedde to life. At that tyme there died at Roome a noble young man, kinſman to the Emperour, whoſe death all for the moſte parte lamented. Many to proue whether he could bee reuiued or no, by any meanes? VVent to Peter, who was counted famous in workyng ſoche mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and deſired him to reuiue him, but the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles beleued not that he could doe it.

If the dedde man be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, let hym ſpeake. If he bee raiſed vp from death, let hym ariſe, walke and talke. He ſaied that it was a phantaſie, not a veritie, that he ſemed to moue his hedde. Lette Simon (ſaied he) be put a ſide from the bedde, and then thei ſhould not ſe the dedde man ſhake his hedde.

He was a verie wicked manne, for he defloured his twoo ſiſters, and at length baniſhed theim. Alſo when he had maried the wife of Memnius, one of his noble capitaines, he conſtrained Memnius euer after, to write &amp; cal him, the father of his wife. He was alſo a very cruell manne, in ſo moche that he was ſaied oftentymes to haue cried out, ſaiyng: I would that the whole people of Roome had but one necke, becauſe I would deſtroye theim all, with one ſtroke, and therefore commaunded very many noble menne to be ſlaine. He neuer did any noble acte, either at home, or els where, but coueteouſly ſpoiled all menne.

                     <p>Some write, that when burnyng of the citie was laied to his charge, he cauſed the fault to bee put vpon the Chriſtians, and therefore began a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cucion againſt them, in whiche perſecucion, beſide many other, he killed Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Paule.</p>
                     <p>He was (ſaied other) of ſo greate riotte and prodigalitie, that he would bathe in cold ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, &amp; fiſhe with nettes of gold, hauing cordes of purple.</p>
                     <p>In him the whole familie of the Caeſars finiſhed, and was conſumed.</p>

But it is not to be graunted. For, let it be that Peter were firſt and chief of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and that the Churche was builte, vpon his priuate perſone (whiche wer an abſurditie to graunte) yet what foundacion ſoeuer the Churche hath it muſte needes bee redemed with the blood of Chriſte, growyng by faithe in Chriſt, and condeſcendyng to his lawes. Now, if the Churche be the true &amp; proper ſpouſe of Chriſt, ſhe taketh hym onely for her Lorde and houſeband, in the chiefeſte libertie ſhe reſteth in hym, as in the hedde, and dependeth of hym, who brought to paſſe, that we are no more vnder the Lawe, but vnder grace, waxyng ſo ſtrong by his free gifte, that beyng releaſed from the care of a ſcholemaiſter, and indued with the ſpirit of God, by his grace we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faithe, whiche woorketh not by coercion, but by penalties, not by menaces &amp; terrours, but onely by true loue.

For what could bee ſpoken with more weight, then that the gates of helle ſhould not preuaile againſte the Churche. But if the gates of hell (whiche as Hierome, Origen, and Ambroſe doe ſaie, be vices and ſynnes) can not preuaile againſt the Churche, no manne will ſaie, that it ought to be vnderſtande of the biſſhoppe of Rome, whiche is a mortall man, for ſo moche as Salomon ſaieth. <hi>Septies in die cadit iuſtus.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen tymes in the daie,<note place="margin">Prouer. 24.</note> the iuſte man falleth.

For, although generally all the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were ſtriken with greate feare, when the Lorde was betraied, yet the faulte of Peter was greater, whiche denied Chriſte in ſo ſhort a tyme. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therefore, he obteined remiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ſinne, by greater clemencie of the ſauiour, greater loue by right is required of him. For, he to whom more is for geuen, ought more to loue. And a little after in the ſame Chapiter, Cirillus dooeth conclude and ſaie. <hi>Terna igitur confeſsione Petri, trinae negationis delic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum euacuatum eſt. &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, by the thirde confeſsion of Peter, the cryme of the three denialles, was made voyde and putte awaye.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7195:312"/>
                     <p>And where Chriſte ſaied, feede my Lambes, he renued that dignitie of the Apoſtleſhip vnto Peter, leaſte through his deniall, whiche chaunced by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine infirmitie, he ſhould ſeme to be abaſed and made weake. <hi>Haec Cyrillus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So by the iudgement of Cyrillus, this place maketh nothyng for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of Peter: nor for the vſurped authoritie of the Biſſhoppe of Rome, as thei falſly allege. But thei bee rather the reconciliacion, recantacion, and the penaunce of Peter, for his former fall (as Cyrillus writeth.)</p>
                     <p>Therefore, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our aduerſaries doe not vnderſtande, in Peter the rock, and will not beleue, that the keies of the kingdome, be geuen to the Churche, thei themſelues doe leeſe them out of their owne handes.

So the ſeate of Peter, yea, rather of Chriſte, in whiche Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the other Apoſtles ſate, was nothyng els, then the pure Goſpell of Chriſt.

For ſoche men doe ſeeke their owne thinges, and not Chriſtes. VVherupon it appereth, the ſeate of Moiſes, is the lawe of Moiſes, and that the ſeate of Chriſte, in whiche Peter and the other Apoſtles ſatte, is the Goſpell: and thei whiche dooe not teache the Lawe of Moiſes, nor the woorde of God, doe not ſitte in Moiſes ſeate, nor in Chriſtes ſeate, nor in the ſeate of Peter, nor of the other Apoſtles, but ſitte in their owne ſeates, commyng before Chriſte, and enteryng by the windowe, not by the dore, as theues &amp; murtherers, doe take vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues honour, not beyng called of God, as Aaron was.

Euery chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche receiueth the worde and doctrine of Peter, is made the throne of Peter, and Peter ſitteth in it. And in an other place he ſaieth. <hi>Videte fratres quomodo ſedetis ſuper cathedram, non enim cathedra facit ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotem, ſed ſacerdos cathedram. &amp;c.</hi> Take hede brethren, how you ſitte in the ſeate, for the ſeate maketh not the prieſte, but the prieſte maketh the ſeate, neither the place ſanctifieth the man, but the man ſanctifieth the place. He that ſitteth well in the ſeate, receiueth the honour of the ſeate He that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ill in the ſeate, doeth iniurie to the ſeate. And therefore, an euill prieſte getteth blame by his prieſthode, and not dignitie. But let vs graunt, that the ſeate of Peter was the place, where he was preſident and preſente. Cregorie notwithſtandyng, affirmeth the Churches of Alexandrina &amp; of Antioche to be no leſſe Peters ſeate, then the churche of Rome. Therefore, it appereth by the premiſsis, that this Eccleſiaſticall power (whoſe fulnes ſome men doe put in the biſſhoppe of Rome) hath no ſoche foundacion in the ſcriptures, as the aduerſaries doe allege. For, if the priuate perſone of Peter, were not the foundacion of the churche, but that the churche was builde in ſoche ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion, as he bare the perſone of all the Apoſtles, and foraſmoche as he firſte pronounced the confeſsion of the chriſtian faithe, that thei whiche dooe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Peter in his ſeate, maie chalenge Peters prerogatiue by this title, then that he whiche ſuccedeth in the kyngdome of Spaine, after the Emperours death, maie therefore chalenge the Empire of Roome, becauſe the kyng of
<pb facs="tcp:7195:313"/> Spain (while he liued) had that honour. Neither Peter was called the chief of the Apoſtles, or the foundacion of the churche, becauſe he was preſidente ouer this Churche, or that Churche, but by a ſpeciall prerogatiue, he was as one choſen emonges them all, to ſtande in ſtede of the reſte. And Peters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, fleſhe and blood did not reueale, but GOD the father, whiche is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Like as Carolus of late, was not Emperour of Rome, becauſe he was kyng of Spaine, but he was Emperour, becauſe thei whiche had authoritie to electe, did ſo chuſe hym. So Chriſt did chuſe Peter, before he was biſſhop of Rome. In the ſeates of Biſſhoppes ſtandeth ſucceſsion, not in vertues and merites. For, often tymes euill men doe ſuccede good men, and good men doe ſuccede euill men. If Chriſt had geuen this prerogatiue to the See of Roome, it ſhould haue remained, Peter beyng dedde. But foraſmoche, there was no mencion made of Rome, why dooe we call Rome the firſt and chiefeſt ſeate, rather then Antioche, and why is not Antioche preferred before Rome, for ſomoche as Peter had his ſeat at Antioche? Yea rather, why ſhould not Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem excell all other Sees, where Peter ſatte many yeres, before he euer ſawe Rome. VVhere alſo he receiued the holy ghoſt, where firſt he began to preache the Goſpell, &amp; made theſe .iiij. ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ſermones. One of the eleccion of Mathie into Iudas roume: the ſeconde of the ſendyng of the holy ghoſt. The iij. to the people, when he made hym that was lame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mothers wombe, to goe vpright againe. The fourthe, to Annas, Caiphas, and the other Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, ſeniours, and Scribes. Furthermore, for that he wrought ſo many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at Hieruſalem, in ſo moche that the people brought forthe the ſicke into the ſtreates, and laied theim on couches and beddes, that when Peter came by, at the leaſt his ſhadowe might ouerſhadowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A greate nomber of the cities alſo, rounde about Hieruſalem came together, and brought theim that were ſicke, and vexed with vncleane ſpirites, whiche were all healed. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, Chriſte ſo greatly eſtemed Hieruſalem, that from thence he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Apoſtles to take their iourney, to preache the Goſpell, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſinnes, not onely to the Iewes, but alſo to all nacions. Chriſt alſo for badde to ſweare by Hieruſalem, becauſe it is the Citie of the greate kyng. Of this citie did the Prophete Eſaie Prophecie. <hi>De Syon exibit lex, &amp; verbum domini de Hieruſalem.</hi> Out of Syon the lawe of the Lorde ſhall come, and the worde of the Lorde out of Hieruſalem. There onely in tymes paſte, was the chiefeſt prieſthoode, there was the temple, altare, <hi>Sancta ſanctorum,</hi> Sacrifices and oblacions. From that daie in the whiche I brought my people out of the lande of Egipte (ſaieth the Lorde) I haue not choſen any other citie to build
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7195:313"/> an houſe in it for my name, but I haue choſen Hieruſalem,<note place="margin">4. Reg. xxi. 2. Par. 33. Eſaie. 41.</note> that my name maie be in it. And to Hieruſalem (ſaieth he) I will giue an Euangeliſt. And the booke of <hi>Sapientia,</hi> by whiche Sapience, authours will haue Chriſte the woorde of God, and the ſeconde perſone in diuinitie to bee ſignified, ſaieth. <hi>In ciuitate ſanctificata requieui, &amp; in Hieruſalem poteſtas mea.</hi> that is.<note place="margin">Eccle. xxiiii</note> In the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued citie haue I reſted, and in Hieruſalem was my power.

                        <note place="margin">Zacha. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp; vocabitur Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem ciuitas veritatis. &amp;c.</hi> I will dwell in the middeſte of Hieruſalem, and Hieruſalem ſhalbe called the citie of truthe.

                     <p>All the whole ſcripture is full of the commendacion, and praiſe of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. Contrariwiſe, Rome is called Babilon, to whom the Lorde threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened malediccion, and curſe in the Apocalips (as witneſſeth Hierome, and Tertullian.)</p>
                     <p>Therefore, it ſhould haue been moche more likely to bee true, that this principalitie and prerogatiue, ſhould haue been lefte at Hieruſalem, whiche citie God hath alwaies beſt loued, whoſe cure &amp; charge, Chriſt hymſelf did peculiarly regarde. Peter alſo was biſſhoppe of Antioche, before he came to Rome. And if thei obiecte and ſaie, that Peter after he left firſt Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and then Antioche: and at laſt went to Roome, then thei muſt graunt, that the eleccion of Peter, to haue appointed and ordeined, the primacie of the churche of Rome, and not the gift and graunt of Chriſt. And ſo by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in that churche the chief authoritie was founded, of the man Peter, &amp; not of Chriſte beyng God, excepte thei will contende and cauill, that it was doen by the permiſsion of God. By the like reaſon, all tyrannicall power is of Gods ſuffraunce. But if by that argumente thei contende, that the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of Peter, was left at Rome, rather then at any other place, becauſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter died at Roome, why dooeth not Hieruſalem farre excell all other places, where Chriſt our ſauiour ſuffred death.</p>

If there bee by the lawe of God, <hi>vnus pater patrum,</hi> and all thynges ought to be reduced to one, why, by a worde compoſed of Greke and Latine, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited foure Patriarches, that is <hi>Patres Patrum,</hi> whche are not ioigned by any relacion, or conference emong them ſelues: but as rulers ouer other, by diuers powers and authorities, and thei them ſelues were ſubiecte to no man. And in the ſame order the biſhop of Roome is rehearſed the laſte. VVhom, if by the lawe of God, he ſhould haue been chief in rule, to ſet in that order, it wer impietie: if by the lawe of man, he ſhould haue borne rule, it were no part of iuſtice and equitie, to place him in the laſt roume.

                        <p>In the Nicene counſaill it was decreed as foloweth: <hi>Statutum eſt, vt apud Alexandriam, &amp; in vrbe Romae vetuſta conſuetudo ſeruetur. &amp;c.</hi> It is decreed, that the auncient cuſtome be obſerued, bothe at Alexandria, and alſo in the citie of Rome, that is, that the one beare the charge, and cares of the Churches of Egipte, and the other, of the churches pertainyng to Rome.</p>

                        <p>The counſaill of Nice alſo decreed, that cauſes ſhould not be determined without that Prouince, in whiche thei ſprang &amp; roſe. And that thei, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7195:316"/> were excommunicate, in one Prouince or Countrie, ſhould bee receiued and admitted againe of none to the communion.

At this counſaill, ſainct Auguſtine was preſent.</p>
                        <p>But after that, Boniface Biſhop of Rome intreated and deſired,<note place="margin">Paulus Dia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>conus de ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtis Roma. lib. xviii.</note> Phocas the Emperour, to confirme &amp; ratifie by lawes, the primacie of Rome, which then had no good grounde. For, the auncient Biſhoppes of Roome, in the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node of Calcedon, refuſed the vniuerſall prerogatiue, being volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarilie offred to them, neither any of them vſed that honour. And Ihon the Patriarche of Conſtantinople, was the firſt whiche durſte call hym ſelf vniuerſall Biſhop. For whiche cauſe he gat great enuie, and ſtirred vp an hurly burly, through the whole worlde, by his contencion, aboute the primacie. But the Biſhoppes of Rome, firſt Pelagius, and then Gregorie reſiſted hym very mightely, nor would attribute vnto him that honor. Notwithſtanding, thei onely ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ihons enterpriſe. For after that, roſe Boniface the .iij, who by themperor Phocas aide and help, obtained that honor and primacie, for him &amp; his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, and that not without greate contencion, becauſe the biſhop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, did ſtifly holde and affirme, that the prerogatiue belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to him.</p>
                        <p>But Iuſtinianus, a very good and godly Emperour, declareth in his lawes that the citie of Conſtantinople, in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, enioyed the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of Rome. And in the later tyme, the See was remoued to Auinion, &amp; there continued a certain ſpace, and was called Peters ſeate. VVhoſe prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, if it bee locall, ought not to haue been tranſlated to any other place: if it wer perſonall, then it died, and ended with the perſone of Peter, vnles we will conſider, that confeſsion of faithe, to be in Peter. VVhereupon it would folowe, the prerogatiue not to correſpond to them, whiche doe ſuccede in the ſeat of Peter, but to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſuccede in the confeſsion, and dignitie of Peter that is, as witneſſeth Hierome, that the authoritie may be vnderſtand to be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of God to biſhops, in what place ſoeuer thei ſhould ſit.

From emong thy brethren, ſhalt thou make a kyng ouer thee: thou ſhalt not ſet a ſtraunger ouer thee, whiche is not thy brother. And when he ſhall ſit vpon the throne of his kingdome then ſhall he write him the lawe, repeated in this booke of Deuteronomie, by the prieſt of the Lenites. By whiche text it manifeſtly appereth, that all nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (at that time) had kinges, and that thei wer firſt conſtitute emong the people, by Gods appointment, who wer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to write the booke of the lawe: that is, that kinges ſhould not onely haue and kepe the booke, but that thei ſhould commaunde it to be obſerued and kept, in ſomoche as it might bee their office, to correcte and puniſhe the offendours, and it is the prieſtes office onely to preache, and to exhibite an example of the lawe to other, if it be required.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the preheminence of a King, is declared in the booke of Eſdras: <hi>Rex autem ſuper omnia praecellit, &amp; dominus eorum,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Eſdras. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>&amp; omne quod dixeri illis, faciunt. &amp;c.</hi> That is. The kyng is yet greater: for he ruleth all thinges, &amp; is Lorde of them, ſo that thei doe all thynges, whiche he commaundeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If he bid them make warre, one againſt an other, thei doe it: If he ſende the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out againſt the enemies, thei go and breake doune mountaines &amp; walles, &amp; tounes. Thei kill, and are killed, and doe not omit the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the kyng: If thei ouercome, thei bryng all to the kyng, as well the ſpoiles, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thynges. And thoſe alſo, whiche go not to warre &amp; battaile, but till the yearth: for when thei haue ſowen it again, thei reape it, and bryng it to the kyng, and compell one an other, to paie tribute to the kyng. Yet he is but one man: If he bid kill, thei kill. If he ſaie, ſpare, thei ſpare. If he bid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſmite, thei ſmite.

                        <p>Aaron alſo the high prieſt, ſaied vnto Moiſes, whiche had the roume of a prince &amp; king: <hi>Ne indignetur dn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s meus.</hi> Let not my lorde be diſpleaſed. &amp;c. And Achimelech the high prieſt,<note place="margin">Exo. xxxii.</note> called him ſelf the ſeruaunt of kyng Saul: <hi>Miſit rex ad accerſendum Achimelech ſacerdotem filium Achitob.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">i. Reg. xxii.</note> 
                           <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is. The kyng ſent to call Achimelech the prieſt, the ſoonne of Ahitus, and all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, to witte, the prieſtes that were in Nob: and thei came all to the kyng. And Saule ſaid: heare now thou ſonne of Achitus. And he anſwered, here I am my lorde.

                        <p>Seyng then, that the high prieſtes, called kynges their Lordes, and theim ſelues the ſeruauntes of kynges: it maie very well be concluded, that kynges are aboue biſhoppes and prieſtes, and that biſhoppes and prieſtes, ought to be ſubiecte and obediente to kynges. In like maner of argumentacion, did ſainct Peter conclude and proue,<note place="margin">i.

                        <p>This thyng alſo is here to be marked and noted, that the kyng adiudged the high prieſt vnto death, ſaiyng: <hi>morte morieris, Achimelech, tu &amp; domꝰ patris tui:</hi> Thou ſhalt ſurely dye, Achimelech, thou and thy fathers houſe. Neither he is to be reprehended, for that he gaue ſentence of death, againſt the high prieſt, but becauſe he gaue wrong ſentence, againſte the innocent.</p>

                        <p>By whiche woordes it appereth, that, authoritie to correcte and puniſhe offendours, pertained onely to Princes and kynges, and not to Prieſtes.</p>

                           <note place="margin">iiii. Reg. 18.</note>Furthermore, Ezechias the king, toke awaie the high places, and brake the Images, and cut doune the groues, and brake in peces the braſen ſerpent,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7195:318"/> whiche Moiſes had made: for vnto that time, the children of Iſrael did burn incenſe to it. And why maie not the abuſe of eccleſiaſticall thinges, and of al thinges, whiche are within the churche, now a daies, pertaine to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion and correccion of the prince?

As Ezechias the good kyng did, to whom there was none to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: who kept all the commaundementes of the lorde, emong al the kinges of Iuda. He executed his power and authoritie, within the precincte of the temple, and he brake by a newe commaundement, the ſerpent erected before by the commaundement of God: when he ſawe it to be worſhipped, againſte the glory of God. If that a king might chaunge thoſe thinges, whiche GOD had commaunded to be doen, yea, and that within the Churche, how moche more maie he alter the thinges commaunded by man, if thei be abuſed?</p>
                        <p>Again, this alſo maketh for our purpoſe, whiche is written in Paralipo.<note place="margin">2. Para. xix</note> thus: <hi>Conſtituit Ioſaphat Iudices terrae, in cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctis ciuitatibꝰ Iudah. &amp;c.</hi> Ioſaphat ſet Iudges in the land, throughout all the ſtrong cities of Iuda, citie by citie. And ſaid to the Iudges: Take hede what ye do: for ye execute not the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of man, but of the lorde, and he will be with you in the cauſe of iudgement. VVherefore, now let the feare of the lorde be vpon you: take hede and doe it: for there is no iniquitie with the lorde our God, neither reſpecte of perſones, nor receiuyng of rewarde.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, in Hieruſalem did Ieoſaphat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitute the Leuites, and of the prieſtes, and of the chief of the families of Iſrael, for the iudgement and cauſe of the lorde: and thei returned to Hieruſalem: And he charged them, ſaiyng.

Be of good courage, and doe it: and the lorde ſhalbe with them whiche be good.</p>
                        <p>Now, I will briefly conferre and examine, theſe ſaiynges before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: The iudgementes of the people of Iſrael, wer the iudgementes of God, &amp; were all deciſed by the preſcripte woorde of God. VVhiche lawe and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, the prieſtes and Prophetes did interprete: but the Iudges were electe
<pb facs="tcp:7195:319"/> &amp; choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of euery tribe in all cities: vnles there aroſe any doubt. For, then the matter was brought to the high prieſtes &amp; Iudges at Hieruſalem (who at that time bare rule) that thei might giue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce together. Neither it was lawfull for any man, to reiect their ſentence, vnder pain of death. So alſo did the Iudges rule in other cities beſide Hieruſalem, where kyng Ioſaphat iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and deciſed all matters, together with the prieſtes, with the Leuites, and with the rulers of houſholdes.</p>
                        <p>If kynges and Princes, were Iudges of the Lawe of GOD, and of thoſe thynges, whiche are preſcribed by the worde of God, whereof thei wer nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authors, nor teachers: how moche more maie thei bee Iudges of all thoſe thynges, whiche are eſtabliſhed and decreed by men?</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2.

                        <p>And a little after in the ſame place it is ſaied, how he appointed the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites, in the houſe of the Lorde, with Cimballes, and with Harpes, according to the commaundemente of Dauid, and Gad the kyng of Seer, and Nathan the Prophete.</p>

                        <p>In the booke of the Machabees, it is written, how Alexander the kyng wrote to Ionathas, ſaiyng: <hi>Nunc conſtituimus te hodic ſummum ſacerdotem ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <p>And thus you ſe, how the collacion, and tranſlacion of the high Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7195:319"/> doeth pertaine alwaies to princes. But now contrary, the high Biſhop of Rome taketh vpon hym to conferre, and giue Empires and kingdomes, to whom pleaſeth hym. VVhiche thyng was neuer read, nor heard of, neither in the olde Teſtament, nor in the newe. In the newe Teſtament alſo,<note place="margin">Math. xvii.</note> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and power of princes, is confirmed by the mouth of Chriſt, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he ſaied to Peter: Goe and paie tribute to Caeſar,<note place="margin">Ihon. xix.</note> for thee &amp; for me. Likewiſe he ſaied to Pilate. Thou ſhouldeſt haue no power ouer me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were giuen thee from aboue. The like is read in many other places of the newe Teſtament, as in ſaincte Paule to the Romaines, where he ſaieth: Let euery ſoule be ſubiecte to the higher powers. He excepteth neither Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor Paule, neither Prieſt, nor Biſhop, neither Cardinall, nor Pope.<note place="margin">Roma. xiii.</note> Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he excepteth none, except hym, that will purchaſe to hym ſelf damnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                        <p>If any will ſaie, that Paule ſpeaketh not here of the Ciuill magiſtrate: let hym firſte expende, that Chriſt taught the Apoſtles, to flee the higheſt and chiefeſte roume. Secondly, that he calleth theim, of whom he here ſpeaketh, Princes, and that thei ought to be feared of euill dooers. Now, the name of a Prince, is not wont to be attributed, ſpecially in the newe Teſtamente, vnto prieſtes, vnles it bee by perticulare addicion, as <hi>Princeps ſacerdotum, princeps Synagogae. &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, where ſainct Paule ſaieth, a little after in the ſame place: <hi>Non ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne cauſa gladium portat.</hi> He beareth not the ſworde, without cauſe. VVho would expounde it of the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours? Is it mete, that thei ſhould bee compaſſed and trained, with Sergeauntes, ſworde bearers. &amp;c. <hi>Non epiſcoporu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> [inquit quida<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>] arma ſunt gladius, &amp; faſcis, ſed pedum &amp; Mitra.</hi> The ſworde and the Axe (ſaieth one) are not the weapons of Biſhoppes: but the Shepheardes ſtaffe and the Mitre.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Paule ſpeaketh here of ſoche Magiſtrates, to whom he teaceth to paie tribute. But tributes wer not paied to prieſtes, but to Caeſars &amp; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. By many other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, it maie be proued, that this place of Paul ought to be expounded of the Ciuill magiſtrate, to whom euery ſoule, yea, the high prieſt hym ſelf, ought to be ſubiecte. And to this agreeth the aunciente learned fathers.</p>
                        <p>Origen vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ſame place of Paule, writeth after this maner: <hi>Iudices mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di partem maximam legis dei implent: omnia enim crimina, quae vindicare vult deus non per Antiſtites, &amp; principes Eccleſiaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſed per mundi iudices voluit vindicare. &amp;c.</hi> The Iudges of the worlde dooe put in vre, the greateſt parte of the Lawe of God: For, all faultes, whiche God will haue reuenged and puniſhed, he will

For you not weighing what doth pleaſe God, through contention whiche you haue agaynst your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, do declare, that your requeſtes and demaundes are inuincible.

VVherfore I will and commaunde you all with all expedition to aſsemble before me, that you may ſhew &amp; declare by your ſelues the integrity of your doings. &amp;c. as you may read in the place before alledged, wher you ſhal find, that Constantinus had not onely a great care ouer the church, but alſo had the Biſhops ſubiect vnto him.</p>
                           <p>A goodly example for the ſame purpoſe alſo Socrates declareth of the Emperour Theodoſius. His wordes be theſe: <hi>Determinata fide cuiuſque religionis, epiſcopi ad aulam vocati conueniunt.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Lib 5. cap. 10.</note> 
                              <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVhen the faith of euery Religion was deciſed and determined, the Biſhops beyng called and ſent for came to the court. Nactarius and Aegelius the preſidents of the Omuſion faith were preſent. Demophilus of the Arrians ſecte. Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius and Cyzicenus of the Macedonian ſecte, were alſo preſent. VVhen they came together, the Emperour receyued them, and takyng the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines written, goeth aſide and very earneſtly prayed to God, that he would aid and help him to choſe the truth. Then reading euery ones doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, did reproue and teare all the doctrines, whiche brought in a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:7195:322"/> of the holy Trini ie, &amp; praiſed and embraced onely that doctrine, whiche did contayne the Omouſion faith. &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Do you not ſee here, that the Emperour was the iudge of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall doctrine? Iuſtinianus hath almoſt omitted nothing in his lawes, that pertayneth to the pietie of diuine things. He made ſtatutes of faith, of heretiques, and of churches, of Biſhops, of the clergie, of Mariage, and and of all ſuch like cauſes. VVhiche he would not haue done, without the example of his aunceſtours and predeceſſours, vnles he had bene perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it pertayned to his office.</p>
                           <p>In England here many Princes are prouided by lawes, that the chiefe rule and authoritie ſhould be conſerued vnto them.</p>
                           <p>Firſt concerning appellations, it was enacted after this maner. If there be appellations, let them procede from the Archedeacon to the Biſhop, from the Biſhop to the Archebiſhop. And if the Archebiſhop be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in miniſtring iuſtice, let them prouoke to the king, that by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement the controuerſie may be determined in the Archebiſhops court. So that it ſhall not be lawfull to go any further without the kinges conſent.</p>
                           <p>And in an other place it is ſaid. It is not lawfull for the Archebiſhops, Biſhops and other perſons of the Realme to go out of the realme, without the kinges licence. And if they will go out (ſo that it pleaſeth the kyng) they ſhall find ſureties that neither in going nor taryeng, they ſhall bring any hurt, either to the king, or to the realme.</p>
                           <p>Turstanus elect Archbiſhop of Yorke, obtained licenſe of the king, to go to the councell appointed of Calixtus. Yet he was depoſed and gaue his othe, that he ſhould not receiue his conſecration of the Pope.</p>
                           <p>Now if he tooke an othe that he ſhould be conſecrate of the Pope, doth it not appeare him to haue counted the preheminence of the kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeruing the liberties of the realm, to be aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope? I might bring in here Canutus king of England, which made lawes eccleſiaſticall, as for example: That there ſhould be no marchandiſe, no hunting, no worldly buſines done vpon the Sonday, and that euery Chriſtian ſhould communicate at the leaſt thriſe in the yeare.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any woman (her huſband being aliue) did commit adulterie, &amp; the matter being proued, that ſhe ſhould loſe her eares and her noſe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thermore, that euery widow ſhould liue without an huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the ſpace of xij. moneths. Otherwiſe ſhe ſhould leeſe her dowry.</p>
                           <p>King Edgarus made lawes, that the tithes ſhould be kept holy from ix. of the clocke at night on the Saterday, vnto the day light of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following.</p>
                           <p>Edmundus the king gathered a great cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell at London about Eaſter,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7195:322"/> at whiche Odo and VVolſtan the Archbiſhop were preſent, where he made theſe lawes: He that committed fornication with a Nunne, let him be puniſhed as a murtherer, and that they whiche committed periurie, ſhould be ſeparated for euer from the companie of God.</p>
                           <p>Iue king of the Saxons enacted, that if any ſeruaunt ſhould worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Sonday by his maſters commaundement, he ſhould be made free. Alſo that euery childe ſhould be chriſtined within thirty nightes vnder the payne of thirty ſhillings. Furthermore if any did fight in the church, he ſhould pay C.xx. ſhillinges.</p>
                           <p>Aluredus the king of England made theſe lawes, that if any commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſcortation with an other mans wife, he ſhould for amendes pay to her huſband xxx. ſhillings. Alſo if any man forſooke his chriſtianitie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an heathen, he ſhould leeſe his life. If any miniſter denied Baptiſme to any that had nede therof, he ſhould die for it.</p>
                           <p>By theſe examples you may euidently ſee, that kinges and princes did intermeddle in cauſes eccleſiaſticall, whiche power was not denied vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo graunted to be theirs by certaine Biſhops of Rome, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the Epiſtle of Eleutherius then Biſhop of Rome, whiche he ſent to Lucius then king of Britanie. In the whiche Epiſtle he calleth the king <hi>Vicarium dei,</hi> ſaying theſe wordes. <hi>Vicarius vero dei eſtis in Regno illo:</hi> You are truly the vicare of God in that kingdome.</p>
                           <p>It manifeſtly appereth alſo <hi>Ex Matheo Pariſienſi,</hi> that authoritie of the inueſtiture of Biſhops did pertaine to kings. He rehearſeth that Hen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry the king gaue the Archbiſhoppricke of Canturburie to Radulphe then Biſhop of London, and did inueste him by the ring and the ſtaffe.</p>
                           <p>The ſame king alſo (as Matheus writeth,) gaue the Biſhoppricke of VVincheſter to Vvillia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gifford. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the ſtatute of Vrbanus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Biſhop of Rome, forbidding, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no clerke vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſures of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church ſhould receiue of the hands of any prince, any eccleſiaſticall dignitie.</p>
                           <p>Ther be innumerable like examples left vnto vs by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wrote the Chronicles of England. If any man will cauill, that theſe lawes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed and being made about matters eccleſiaſticall, do importe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall authoritie &amp; not ſpirituall, let him know, that Linwood vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>We ought not to be ſcrupulous and inquiſitiue of the election of our brethren. We muſt eſteme and iudge their election by their vocation and calling.

For God doth ſegregate and deuyde them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world, which is an argument, a ſigne and token of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7195:323"/> and iudgement of conſcience. For who knoweth not him ſelfe to be woorthy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, when he doth ſynne and tranſgreſſe Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmaundement? Who is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, but that God is offended with wickednes? This place therefore doth ſeme rather to be ſpoken of thexterne and outward diſcerning and iudging the godlye from the vngodly.</p>
                     <p>God doth poure and exhibite oft times hys gyfts indifferently without reſpect of perſons. He geueth riches, ſtrength of body, learning, worldly wyſedome, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, health and beuty, as wel to the vngodly, as to the godly. No man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, concerning thys outward ſhew &amp; externe gyftes, whom god loueth, or whom god hateth. For as wel may the reprobates haue them, as the elect. And I pray you, what ſhould moue Salomon in that place to ſay; that no man ſhould be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red of gods fauour? All that be true Chriſtians, and ſurely cleaue vnto Chriſt, do know them ſelues to be elect in Chriſt, before the foundacion of the world was layd. They know, I ſay, by the word of god, that they be beloued vnto god the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he gaue hys onely begotten ſonne to dye for them. And what is the fayth of a chriſtian man, but an aſſured truſt in the mercy of god for Chriſts ſake?</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, the promiſe of god is moſt firme, true, and ſure: <hi>qui crediderit, ſaluus erit,,</hi> he that beleueth (ſayth Chriſt) ſhalbe ſaued. Now if thou beleue the goſpel, thou art than certayne of the remiſſion of ſynnes, than art thou aſſured of gods fauour, than needeſt thou not to doubt of euerlaſting ſaluation. Paule ſayth to the Romaynes: <hi>Spiritus Dei teſtatur cum ſpiritu noſtro,</hi>

                     <p>Dauid a moſt noble Prince, deliuered Iſrael from al their enemies: yet both in hys life tyme &amp; after his death they were a moſt vnthankeful people.

                     <p>Other writers referre this text vnto God, after this ſence: God (ſay they) hath whom he loueth, and whom he hateth, ſome he hath elected, and ſome he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, as it is written in the Prophet Malachy: <hi>Iacob dilexi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Eſau autem odio ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bui.</hi> Iacob I loued, Eſau I hated. Notwithſtanding, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hym ſelf can iudge by the outward ſhew whom God hath choſen, nor whom he hath forſaken, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can iudge, whether one be elect or reiect, neyther by hys proſperitie nor by hys ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, for theſe thyngs happen indifferently, as well to the wicked, as to the good. And who doth know whether a man ſuffereth any croſſe or affliction, to his profe or to hys punyſhment. Truely none ought to iudge of the euent of thynges whether they be good or bad, for he is acceptable to God, whom god fauoureth, &amp; whoſoeuer beleueth truely in god, whether he ſuffreth aduerſitie or proſperitie.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide god hateth hym which doth not beleue, whether he be fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in thys worlde or vnfortunate. <hi>Vniuerſa aeque eueniunt iuſto et impio.</hi> All thynges come a lyke to all, and the ſame condition is to the iuſte,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.</note> and to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. If onely good things ſhould happen onely to the good, &amp; euill thyngs ſhould chaunce onely to the euill, then we might eaſely iudge, who is in gods fauour, &amp; who out of fauour, but we ſee by experience the outwarde euent to be equall, as well to the iuſt, as to the vniuſte.</p>
                     <p>To the iuſte that liue vprightly, and be frendly and louyng to theyr neighbours
<pb facs="tcp:7195:324"/> many promyſes are made. As where it is ſayd in the Scriptures: <hi>Eſtote miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 6.</note>

                     <p>Agayne, on the contrary ſide, the holy Scriptures do manace and threaten euil thinges to thoſe whiche liue vncharitably and vnmercifully toward their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

                     <p>Agayn in an other place it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>Viduae et pupillo no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nocebits. et ce.</hi> You ſhal not hurt the widow &amp; the fatherles,<note place="margin">Exod. 22.</note> for they ſhal cry to me, &amp; I wil hear the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So you ſee that to the good, bleſſing, to the wicked, curſing is promiſed in the law, and yet we ſee the good oft tymes ſubiect to malediction, and the wicked to be partakers of benediction. We ſee ſome whiche make their bodyes a liuely Sacrifice vnto God, we ſee other that liue diſſolutely, and in al kinds of pleaſure: yet the one is not one heare the more fortunate in this worlde then thother. We ſee ſome which be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured perſons, to liue moſte welthely, we ſee other that be conſtant, faithfull, and true, to liue in much miſery. So that by the outward appearance and ſhew we do not nor can iudge who is in Gods fauour, and who is out of fauour.</p>
                     <p>Some of the diuines which be of a more ſubtile iudgement, do expounde this place of Solomon of finall perſeuerance. For no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſay they) doth knowe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finally or in thend he ſhalbe receiued into glory, or ſent into pain. For he that is good this day, and as touching preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iuſtice, is worthy of loue: may be the next daye or within few dayes after in Gods diſfauor.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore, although for a time a manne be good, and ſo accepted of God: Yet it followeth not that he perſuade him ſelfe in his owne conceit, he ſhall ſo perſiſt &amp; finally perſeuer. For many be called, but few are choſen, and as ſaynt Paul ſaith: <hi>Qui ſtat,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>vidiat ne cadat,</hi> he that ſtandeth, let him take heede he fal not. And in an other place: <hi>tu fide ſtas, noli altum ſapere, ſed time:</hi> thou ſtandeſt faſt in faiih, be not to hie minded, but feare.</p>
                     <p>Saint Peter exhorteth them that ar called to make their vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſure through good workes.</p>
                     <p>Finally, they which according to preſent iuſtice be worthy hatred, ought not to be iudged, that they ſhall ſo continue vnto thend, for he that is now bad, may to morow be good, as Paule, Zacheus, Mathew, Marie Magdalene, and the theife that hanged vpon the croſſe, with other.</p>
                     <p>This ſhalbe ſufficient for the queſtion. Now to the firſt limme of our preſent di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſion in this leſſon, that is, how we be elect.</p>
                     <p>This election doth flow and ſpring not out of our ſelues, not out of our frewil, not out of oure obedience, but as Peter ſayth here, <hi>Secundum praecognitionem Dei patris,</hi> by the foreknowledge of god the father, for the preſcience of God is the very well and ofſpring, is the firſt and chief cauſe that god did know with him ſelfe, before the worlde was made, whom he would electe and chooſe to ſaluation. But here is one caution &amp; rule to be obſerued, that is, to weighe diligently what maner of thyng the preſcience or foreknowledge of god is.</p>
                     <p>The ſchole men do ſay that god did and doth foreſee the merites, deſertes, and workes of euery man, and ſo doth diſcerne the reprobates from the elect, as euery one ſhalbe worthy of the ſtate and condition for his workes ſake. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth alwayes and euery where ſet forth the purpoſe of god, in whiche onely our ſaluation is grounded agaynſt our merites and deſertes.</p>
                     <p>Therfore, when Peter here doth cal them elect by the foreknowledge of god the father, he ſignifieth that the cauſe therof dependeth of none other thing, but that it ought to be ſought onely in god and of god. Therfore, gods preſcience and preco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnition doth remoue and put a parte all the reſpect of the worthynes of man. And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7195:324"/> ſeyng that the will of god is the chief, principall, and firſt cauſe of our election) be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the whiche wil of god, there ought none other cauſe to be admitted) it is, not meete nor like, that god ſhould be moued of our good workes and merites, which he ſaw before. And agaynſt this ſentence ſpeaketh ſaint Paul to the Corinthians, ſaying: <hi>Quid habes ꝙ non accepiſti? et ſi accepiſti, quid gloriaris, quaſi non acceperis?</hi> What haſt thou, which thou haſt not receued? and if thou haue receued, why dooſt thou boaſt, as though thou haſt not receued? And here I do meruaile of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, whiche faint that there is <hi>Vniuerſalis gratia,</hi> an vniuerſall grace ſet by the benefite of god before all men, whiche grace they that will, do chuſe, and they that will, do and may refuſe. Agaynſt this opinion ſpeaketh ſaint Auſten ſaying:<note place="margin">lib. de praed. cap. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Quid oramus pro nolentibus credere? niſi vt Deus operetur in illis et velle.</hi> Why pray we for thoſe that will not beleue? but that god may worke in them to will.</p>
                     <p>Saint Hierome writeth thus: <hi>Velle, et currere meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt, ſed ipſum meum, ſine Dei ſemper auxilio non erit meum, dicit enim Apoſtolus:</hi>

                        <hi>Deus eſt qui operatur in nobis velle et perficere,</hi> that is to will, and to runne is my part, but the ſame mine, with out alwayes the helpe of God, ſhall not be mine, for thapoſtle ſaith: It is god that worketh in vs to will, and to bringe to paſſe. Theſe aſſertions do not proue, that we ſhould cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our ſelues (as they ſay) <hi>Solu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paſſiue,</hi> to the chuſing of good things, for we are moued by the ſpirite of good, &amp; being impelled, we alſo do that whiche Thapoſtle ſayth to the Romaines: <hi>Qui ſpiritu Dei aguntur, hi ſunt filii Dei:</hi> They that are moued by the ſpirite of God, be the ſonnes of God.<note place="margin">cap. 8.</note> And a litle before he ſayd: <hi>Per ſpiritum adoptionis, quem accepimus, clamamus Abba Pater:</hi> by the ſpirit of adoption, whiche we haue receaued, we crie, <hi>Abba Pater.</hi>

                  <p>If thou do not preſently feele and perceyue in thy minde a moſt perfecte faith, do not diſpaire. The ſcripture ſaith: The earth bringeth forth fruite freelie, &amp; of her owne accorde, but firſte it is graſſe, then it is ſtalke, and laſte of all it is ful corne. Euen after that maner hath faith her increaſe. The Apoſtles (as Marke recordeth) prayed, ſaying: <hi>Domine adauge nobis fidem:</hi> Lorde increaſe our faith. Likewiſe it is mencioned in the .9. of Marke, howe a certaine poore wretch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng his ſonne vexed with a deuil, cried out vnto Chriſt: <hi>age, ſi quid potesdomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, ſubueni miſertus nobis.</hi> O Lorde, if thou canſte, helpe, hauinge pitye on vs. And furthwith he heard the Lord ſaying vnto him againe: If thou canſt beleue, all things are poſſible to him that doth beleue. This poore miſer cried out again: O Lorde helpe myne incredulitie. Here you may ſee that this man did beleue, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng faith in his minde geuen him of god: yet he iudged it to be ſo weake, that it needed the helpe of god. And this faith of his, if it had ben compared, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred with an abſolute and perfecte faith, it might ſeeme rather an incredulitie, then a faith.

                  <p>If any man therfore doth feele faith to be in his minde (although it be vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſlender and weake) let him not diſpaire, but caſte himſelfe wholy vpon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Let him not preſume of his owne power and free will, let hym praye, and cal inceſſantly for the increaſe of faith, let him remember the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table wordes of Chriſt: <hi>petite, &amp; dabitur vobis, quaerite, &amp; inuenietis, pulſate, et a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perietur vobis:</hi> Aſke, and it ſhalbe geuen to you, ſeeke, &amp; you ſhal find, knock,<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> and it ſhalbe opened vnto you. Theſe and ſuch lyke comfortable places of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ought more to moue and confirme our mindes of the great good will of god towarde vs. then the ſuggeſtions of the diuil to feare vs. By the whiche ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and temptacions he goeth about not only to ſubuert and ouerthrow the hope of our election, to make god ſuſpect vnto vs, as though god did hate his creature, and had rather haue it loſt, then ſaued.</p>
                  <p>Let vs firmly printe in our mindes that god hath electe and choſen vs in Chriſt, and for Chriſts ſake hath predeſtinate vs to lyfe, and doth increaſe the ſame faith to them that ſhall aſke and praye for it, and inſpireth vs, that we maye truly pray and aſke, for theſe and ſuch other lyke giftes.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I haue diſcourſed the three partes of this prelection, accordyng to my promiſe. Nowe, lette vs go a litle further in the texte. It foloweth: <hi>In obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam et aſperſionem ſanguinis Ieſu Chriſti,</hi> through obedience and ſprinklynge of the bloud of Chriſt, that is, ſaith Peter, the true ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctifieng of the ſpirite is to obey the goſpell, and to beleue in Chriſt, which hath made vs worthie of eternall lyfe, by the ſheddyng of his owne bloud, and by ſprinklyng of our conſcience with the ſame bloud.</p>
                  <p>And here Peter ſeemeth to haue had a reſpecte to the olde ceremonie of bloude ſprinkling. For euen as it was not enough then among the Iewes, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ſhould be offered, and the bloud therof ſhed, vnles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people had ben ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the ſame: So now at this preſent it ſhal profit vs nothing that Chriſts bloud is ſhed, vnles our conſciences be clenſed and purified therwith: which thing is done by the miniſterie of the holy ghoſt, whiche doth ſprinkle our conſciences with Chriſts bloud, to waſhe them withal.</p>
                  <p>Dauid ſpeaketh of this kynd of ſprinkling, ſaying: <hi>Aſperges me domine hyſopo, &amp; mundabor, lauabis me, &amp; ſuper niuem dealbabor:</hi> ſprinkle me, Lorde,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſope,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:326"/> and I ſhalbe cleane, thou ſhalte waſhe me, and I ſhalbe whiter then ſnowe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Leu. 14. 3. Sacrificiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>We reade in Leuiticus of the ſacrifice that did purifie and clenſe from the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie. They tooke two ſparows, one of them was killed, and put in an earthen pot, hauinge faire and cleane running water, the other ſparow being a liue, his winges with Ceder wodde, and ſcarlet cloth with byſope wer dipped in the blood of the ſlaine ſparrow, and he that was infected and diſeaſed with the leproſie was ſprinkled with all. The ſparow that was ſlain, ſignified the humanitie of Chriſt, which was put to death. The ſparowe that was lefte a lyue, ſignifieth the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſte, which was impaſſible and could not be hurte.</p>
                  <p>The leproſie of the bodye betokeneth the ſinne of the ſoule. Hiſope is a lowe herbe, and of a ſwete ſauour, and it ſignifieth our fayth, by the whiche our hartes are purified. And nowe crieth Dauid, ſaying: If thou O God ſhalte ſprinkle me with thy grace, and with faith, as it were with a bundle of hyſope dipped in the bloud of Chriſt, and ſo ſhalt waſh my ſpottes, than ſhal I by &amp; by be made cleane, and I ſhal become whiter then ſnow. I know Lord, I know, ſaith Dauid, that I neede not the ſlaughter of goates and bullocks, but this I know, that the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeng and clenſing of the ſoule is ſet only in the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, with whoſe bloud, whoſoeuer is ſprinkled, he is waſhed and clenſed from all his ſinnes. And vnto this end alludeth ſainct Peter here in this place.</p>
                  <p>Now, the whole minde of Peter in this place is this: we be predeſtinat, electe, and choſen of God vnto ſaluation. This election is not diſpoſed and diſpenſed raſhlye, but by the redemption of Chriſte, in the whiche is declared both the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and Iuſtice of god. In this Chriſt onely we muſt beleue, &amp; obey his doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Therfore, they are muche deceiued and do greatly erre, which preach, bragge and boaſte onely of election, and do reiecte, and neglecte faith, the fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes, feruent and deuoute praiers, as things vnprofitable, as though the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of god ſhould be a raſhe and a bare thing: <hi>quos praeſciuit, eoſdem praefiniuit, conformes eſſe imaginis filii ſui:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> thoſe which he knewe before (ſaith Paule) he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ordeined before, that they ſhould be like faſhioned to the ſhape of his ſonne. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs gather together the whole ſumme of Peters minde, which is this.</p>
                  <p>Our ſaluation floweth of the free election of god, but this election muſt be conſidered with the experience of faith, in that that god doth ſanctifie vs with his holy ſpirite.</p>
                  <p>Finally, there be two effectes or endes of our vocation, one is obedience, by the whiche we muſt vnderſtand newnes of life, the other is the ſprinklynge of Chriſts bloud, by the which is notified the remiſſion of ſinnes, and both theſe are the workes of the holy ghoſt. And therupon Peter concludeth, that we oughte not to ſeparat election, from vocation, nor the free iuſtifieng, of faith from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of lyfe.</p>
                  <p>It foloweth in the texte: <hi>gratia &amp; pax multiplicetur uobis,</hi> grace and peace be multiplied vnto you. There is nothinge that ought more to be wiſhed and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs, then to haue god fauorable and mercifull vnto vs, which is ſignified here by this worde <hi>gratia.</hi> And after to deſire that proſperitie and good ſucceſſe of al things maye flowe and come from god toward vs, whiche is ſignified by this word <hi>Pax.</hi> For howſo euer all thinges in this worlde be luckie, pleaſante, and for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tunate vnto vs: yet if god therwith be not fauorable, that bleſſinge and ſucceſſe whiche we haue, is turned into curſe.</p>
                  <p>Therfore the only fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacion, ground &amp; ſtay of our felicitie, is the fauor, &amp; beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of god, by the which fauour it is brought to paſſe, that we haue the fruition of the very true and ſound proſperitie. Yea, and that our ſaluation and health is promoted and furthered in the very ſtormes of aduerſitie. <hi>Gratia &amp; pax:</hi> Grace here, I ſay, betokeneth the fauour of god, which although it beginne here in vs, yet it is requiſite and neceſſarie that it waxe and growe in vs daily more and more, vntil our dieng daye.</p>

                  <p>Grace, I tell you, betokeneth here, <hi>fauorem,</hi> gods fauor, by the whiche we are not onely made amiable, acceptable, and beloued vnto god, but alſo we obteyne all ſpiritual dowries and giftes, which eyther pertaine to all godlines, or els to the vtilitie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of our neyghbours.</p>

                  <p>It is moſte true, that godly and faithful men are ſubiecte, and like to ſuſteine, as long as they liue here in this world, perſecutions, afflictions, and aduerſities, at one time or other. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, god doth with his great fauour and mercy ſo adourne and decke his holy ſainctes, that the very reproches and troubles of the world, do turne to their profit and glorie. And god doth ſo comforte them in their aduerſitie, that euen then be they moſt quiet, moſt ioiful, and moſt reioyſing, when they be in the middle of death. What preſidentes haue we had, I pray you, theſe late yeares, of thoſe godlye Martyrs, which teſtified chriſts truth be ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge theyr bloud? This grace and fauour of God is geuen vnto man without his merites or deſertes.</p>
                  <p>Saincte Ambroſe interpreting this worde, grace, ſaith after this maner: <hi>quia hoc conſtitutum eſt a Deo, et cae.</hi> becauſe god hath ordeined, that they whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Chriſt, ſhalbe ſaued without works, by faith onely, we ſhal freely obteine remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>I do not a litle meruaile, that ſome of the ſchole men are ſuche ſtoute defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of mans power, and ſo ſmal fauorers of the grace of Chriſt, that they are not aſhamed to ſay and to write, that the very infidels and heathen, which are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the goſpel, may with theyr moral vertues deſerue (as they term it) <hi>prima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gratiam,</hi> the-firſt grace. Whiche doctrine, becauſe they would make it ſeeme and appeare more probable, they affirme, that ſuch workes done before faith, do not merite and deſerue Gods fauour and grace <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> abſolutely, but as they terme it, <hi>de congruo,</hi> with a conuenience and meetenes. Mary, ſay they, we dare not affirme, that they merite <hi>de condigno.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although theſe morall actions and vertues may be nombred generally amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g thoſe thinges, that be called, <hi>bona,</hi> good: yet as concernyng the auctors and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of them, from whom they come, becauſe they be without faith, thoſe actions and morall vertues are very ſinne, and do diſpleaſe god. For as long as we be without Chriſt, the holy ghoſt declareth vs to be the ſonnes of wrath: that is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of god.</p>
                  <p>Our ſauiour Chriſt ſaith: <hi>qui non credit in filium, non habebit vitam aeterna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ira dei manet ſuper eum:</hi> he that beleueth not in the ſonne, ſhall not haue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and the wrath of god ſhal abide vpon him.

                  <p>By theſe teſtimonies, and ſuch other like places, it is and may be ſufficiently proued, that their doctrine is vaine and moſt fooliſhe, whiche ſay, that Infideles may merite <hi>primam gratiam de congruo,</hi> as they terme it.

And if you would know, what theſe workes of ſupererogation be, you may learne them out of theyr popiſhe and peuiſhe bokes, ſome of them I wil rehearſe: to heare ſixe or ſeuen maſſes on a day, to go on pilgrimage from poſt to piller, to make choiſe and difference of meates, as to put more holines in fiſhe then in fleſh, to builde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries and chauntries, to make vowes, and to profeſſe ſingle life, to forſake father, and mother without their conſent &amp; good wil obtained, to become monks, friers, chanons and Nuns, &amp;c. But who hauing any ſalt in hym (as the prouerb ſayth) wil not counte theſe thinges to be vaine, fond, ſuperfluous and fooliſh, for the whiche the Lord ſhal ſay at the daye of the iudgement, as it is written in the prophet Eſaie: <hi>quis haec requiſiuit de manibus veſtris?</hi> who required theſe things a your handes?</p>
                  <p>Sainct Auguſtin writeth: <hi>quum dicitur toto corde, tota mente, tota anima, et omnibus viribus,</hi>

                        <p>Firſt, the diuines do define deſtenie to be a certain diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in things moueable, by the which the prouidence of god knitteth all things in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Or thus, deſtenie is an ordinance or conſtitution of the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cauſes, to bring forth their effectes in the inferiour thinges, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7195:329"/> which they haue of god. This ordinance may be two wayes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: firſt, as it is ioyned in the proſpecte of the mind of god, ordenyng and diuiding all things in their places, tymes, mouings, and maner: and ſo it is called the prouidence of god.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the ſame ordinance is digeſted and applied by tymes in the midle cauſes appointed of God to bring forth their proper effects: and ſo it is called <hi>fatum,</hi> deſtenie. Vvherby it is manifeſt, that the will and prouidence of God may by called <hi>fatum,</hi> deſtenie, <hi>cauſaliter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the ſame diſpoſition and order of the ſecond cauſes, concernynge their effectes dependyng of the will and prouidence of God, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>fatum eſſentialiter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The diſpoſition of the ſeconde cauſes (as Thomas ſaith) is called <hi>fatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a fari,</hi> to ſpeake, as though you wold ſay,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. cont. entiles. c. 93</note> the pronouncing and vtterance of gods prouidence. For God pronounced his prouidence, <hi>per fatum,</hi> by deſtenie, euen as man vttereth what he hath conceyued in his harte, by voice and wordes. And like as an artificer declareth the forme &amp; faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that he maketh, conceyued in his minde, by the effecte and finiſhing of the worke, by the diſpoſitions of times: ſo doth god by his prouidence, <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> diſpoſe what things he would haue done, <hi>&amp; per fatum</hi> doth adminiſter them diuerſe wayes, and at ſondry times. And vpon this thre thinges may be obſerued, and ratified: firſt, what things are ſubiect to deſtenie, and what things not ſubiecte to deſtenie. For, in ſo much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenie (as the diuines ſay) is an ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſecond cauſes to the effects foreſene of God, it foloweth, that onely thoſe things are ſubiect to deſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which are ſubiecte to the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cauſes, neither are they ſubiect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenie. As for example, the creation of the firſt things, that is, angels, celeſtiall bodies, time, and matter of the foure eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the firſt ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of all kindes of thinges, which were brought forth in the beginning, the glorifieng of the heauenly ſubſtaunces, the iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the wicked, and the ſoules whiche are alwayes created a newe. For all theſe thinges did flow, and were created of God immediatly, nether could they, nor can otherwſe be brought forth. Therfore, they are not ſubiect to deſtenie, for thoſe things that ar done of the ſuperior, are not chaunged or altered of the inferior. Vvherupon Boetius ſaith: Thoſe things which are moſte nere to the diuinitie, being eſtabliſhed and made ſure, do excede wholye all fatal order. But thoſe thinges that are remoued, and ſomwhat a farre of from the firſt cauſe, the further they be of from it, ſo much the more they are ſubiecte to fatall order.</p>
                        <p>Therfore, thoſe thinges which are done of God, are ſubiect onely to him. But other particuler and natural effects are ſubiect to the mouings of the elements, &amp; the mouings of the heauenly bodies, and of that part which is called <hi>primum mobile,</hi> and finally to the prouidence of God, of
<pb facs="tcp:7195:330"/> whom al things haue their ſtedfaſtnes, and without whom nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in his owne ſtate. For, if you take away the firſt, the ſecond alſo is taken away. Secondly, it is to be conſidered how the faithful chriſtians may graunt, that there is <hi>fatum,</hi> deſtenie, for if deſtenie be taken for the diſpoſition &amp; conſtellations of the ſtarres and planets (in which any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is conceiued or borne) enforcing all the inferior effects beſide the will, and without the worke of God: ſo <hi>fatum</hi> is to be denied, as Gregorie ſaith: <hi>abſit à fidelium cordibus, vt eſſe fatum aliquid dicant:</hi> that is, let it be far from the harts of the faithful, to ſay, that ther is any deſtenie. But if <hi>fatum</hi> be taken for the diſpoſition of the ſecond cauſes, and for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce of humaine actions, being referred to the prouidence of god, as appointed by him, and ſpoken before him: ſo may we graunt, that ther is <hi>fatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> deſtenie, although the holy fathers haue refuſed to vſe this worde, <hi>fatum,</hi> by reaſon of thoſe men which wreſted this word to the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, and fatal neceſsitie of al things. Vvherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Auguſtin ſaith: <hi>Si propterea quis res humanas fato tribuit,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 5. de ciui dei. cap. 1</note> 
                           <hi>quia ipſam dei voluntate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vel poteſtatem fati nomine appellat, ſententiam teneat, &amp; linguam corrigat:</hi> If any man do attribute humaine affaires to deſtenie, becauſe he calleth the will or power of god by the name of <hi>Fatum,</hi> deſtenie: let him refrain his iudgment, and amend his toung. Thirdly, it is to be conſidered how the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god and deſtenie do differ. For the diſpoſition of things, which are to be produced, gouerned &amp; conſerued, by the proſpect &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of God, is called the prouidence of God. But the ſame diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the middle cauſes ordeined of God to the bringing forth of the effects, &amp; declared in times, is called deſtenie. Alſo they differ in this, that as wel neceſſarie things, as things that happen, are ſubiect to the prouidence of God: yea deſtenie it ſelfe is ſubiect to the diuine prouidence: but onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable things are ſubiect to deſtenie. Furthermore, they differ in this, that the diuine prouidence beinge conſtitute and ſet in God the highe and chief ruler of all things (as Boetius ſaith) conſiſteth in God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenie conſiſteth only in the ſecond cauſes. Alſo they differ in this, that the diuine prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is called deſtenie <hi>cauſaliter,</hi> in aſmuch as the fatall diſpoſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dependeth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of gods prouidence. But the diſpoſition of the ſecond cauſes, in it ſelf, is called deſtenie <hi>eſſentialiter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, they differ, becauſe the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god is alwaies vnmoueable, remaining, permanent, and cauſeth al things to be moued. But deſtenie, for ſomuch as it is in things moueable, is alſo moueable. To be ſhort, that ther is no ſuch <hi>fatum,</hi> as the Stoiks do imagin, <hi>I</hi> wil make it plain by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting vnto you certaine verſes, which are recited in a certaine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude or plaie intituled <hi>Aegio.</hi> In the which playe .ij. perſons interlocuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie do diſpute, the one alledging for the defence of deſtenie and fatall neceſsitie, and the other confuting the ſame.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, that there be ſixe kindes of Sacrifices, whiche the Church doth offer dayly vnto God.</p>
                     <p>The firſt kinde is the Sacrifice of a contrite minde, and of an humble ſpirite: Of the whiche Dauid doth ſpeake in his Pſalme: <hi>Sacrificium Deo
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7195:332"/> ſpiritus contribulatus, cor contritum &amp; humiliatum, Deus no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſpicies:</hi> A troubled ſpirite is a Sacrifice to God, a contrite and an humble hart,<note place="margin">Pſal 51.</note> O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</p>
                     <p>It can not be declared how acceptably the diuine maieſtie doth behold that hart, which doth vexe it ſelfe with the labour of repentaunce, which doth mollifie his hart with weping and teares, whiche beating it ſelf with the morter of Gods loue, with the peſtle of wiſedom, doth make of it ſelfe a moſt ſweete and precious ointment, which beyng layd vp in ſtore in the beautifull boxe of faith, and ſeaſoned and made ſweete with a moſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pouder of prayers, doth conſecrate and ſanctifie it ſelfe vnto the Lord. It can not be, that the hart ſo moued and affected can be deſpiſed of God. VVhat other thyng did that ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſignifie, which that ſinfull woman did poure out of an Alabaſter boxe vpon the head of Ieſus?</p>
                     <p>The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d kind of Sacrifice, is, <hi>Vituli labiorum</hi> the calues of the lips:<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> of the whiche Saint Paul ſpeaketh ſaying: By him therfore we offer the Sacrifice of laude and praiſe alwayes vnto God, that is to ſay, the fruites of thoſe lippes whiche confeſse his name. And in this kinde are contained prayers, confeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, geuing of thankes, and inuocation.<note place="margin">Cap. 4</note> Of this maner of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ſpeaketh Oſeas.</p>
                     <p>The third kind of Sacrifice is benificence, mercy, pitie, almes ſhewed and exhibite vnto the poore: of the which Micheas the Prophet ſpeaketh after this maner: <hi>Indicabo tibi, homo, quid ſit bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offerre, &amp; quid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus requirat a te: vtique facere iudiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; diligere miſericordia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> I will ſhewe thee, O man, what it is to offer good thinges, and what God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of thee: to do iuſt iudgement, and to loue mercy.</p>
                     <p>Alſo S. Paul in the Epiſtle to the Philippians calleth that almes,<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> which came from them, ſent vnto him by Epaphroditus, and an odor that ſmel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth ſweet, a Sacrifice accepted and pleaſaunt vnto God.</p>
                     <p>The fourth kinde of Sacrifice is the mortification of the fleſhe by the ſpirite, in the whiche we offer our bodyes a lyuely, holy, and acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crifice vnto God. Of this kinde writeth Saint Paul in the Epiſtle to the Romaines, ſaying: I beſech you brethren by the mercifulnes of God,<note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> that you make your bodies a quicke Sacrifice, holy and acceptable vnto God, that is to ſay, that you kill and ſlay all your fleſhly concupiſcence and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall luſtes. And ſo bring your fleſh, through the helpe of your ſpirites, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obedience of Gods holy law.</p>
                     <p>By theſe wordes it may appeare, that the ſupper of the Lord is not a Sacrifice propitiatorie, to be offered of the Prieſtes for the expiation and remiſsion of ſinnes, both of the liuyng and of the dead.</p>
                     <p>And we ſhall not finde in all the holy Scriptures, that the Miniſters of the newe Teſtament be called either <hi>Sacerdotes,</hi> or <hi>Sacrifici.</hi> For that
<pb facs="tcp:7195:333"/> is attributed wholy and onely vnto Chriſt. And as it is written in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebrues, the Prieſthood was tranſlated vpon him. And for as much as he remaineth for euer, he nedeth no ſucceſſor.</p>

                        <p>Agayn, the Hebrue word, <hi>Hozi,</hi> doth not ſignifie to offer, but to bring forth a thing.

               <p>Concernyng the firſt: after that Peter hath abſolued &amp; made an end of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphe and inſcription of this Epiſtle, now he goeth to that part, whiche is called <hi>Exordium,</hi> that is, the entraunce of his matter, in the whiche entrie he doth inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate or couertly creepe into the mindes of his hearers by a certayn gratulation, or thankesgeuing. The tenor and meaning of theſe wordes is this:</p>
               <p>Bleſſed, prayſed, and thanked be God, which by his mercy through Chriſt hath redemed vs from death, and hath geuen vs life euerlaſting. He doth proſecute eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry member, and almoſt euery worde copiouſly and largely: partly, to commend &amp; ſet forth the great benefites of God, &amp; partly, to make away both plaine and profi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table to that whiche foloweth.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all (ſayth he) God is to be prayſed, bleſſed, and thanked, for the Sacrifice of prayſe and thankes geuyng is an amiable and acceptable ſeruice vnto God. Whiche Sacrifice who ſoeuer doth not vſe to offer vnto God, he is not worthy of the name of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Afterward, he declareth who is that God, that muſt be ſo prayſed and thanked: verely, that is to ſay, the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. By the whiche wordes he doth ſhew and ſet forth the diuinitie of Chriſt, and the ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the perſon.</p>
               <p>Now for to be god is none other thing, then to be beneficiall, gentle, and bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, good &amp; helping, &amp; finally to be the preſeruer, keper &amp; defender of al perſons.</p>
               <p>For aſmuch then as god did open, ſhewe, exhibite, and geue this great benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and liberalitie to the world, euen then ſpecially, when he ſent his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne into the worlde: It is not without cauſe that he is called the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as the which, doth ſhew himſelf ſpecially god in Chriſt.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7195:335"/>
               <p>For, as god in time paſt called him ſelfe the god of Abraham, and would with that note and title be diſcerned and knowne from all fained and falſe gods: Euen ſo after he had manifeſted &amp; made him ſelf knowne in his ſonne Chriſt, he would be none otherwiſe knowne but by the ſame Chriſt.</p>

For he that will know god, and haue god as a true god, let him euer inueſte, adorne, and decke god with this title: <hi>God the father of Chriſt.</hi> For as often as our minde doth ſeeke god, and looke vpon god, except Chriſt be alſo conceaued, it wilbe a vayne, a confuſed, and a deſperate conception and contemplation. For without Chriſt, the goodnes and liberalitie of god can neuer be taſted nor perceaued of vs.</p>

And this is the ſum and the ſcope of the whole goſpell. And I beſeche you marke here, what an apt and meete Epitheton Peter putteth to this worde, Mercye, he calleth it an aboundant, a great, and a riche mercy.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 103.</note>The Prophet Dauid ſayth in his Pſalmes: <hi>Miſerator et miſericors dominus, lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ganimis, et multum miſericors, non imperpetuum iraſcetur:</hi> The Lord is full of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paſſion and mercy, ſlowe to anger, and of great kindnes, he will not alway chide, neither kepe his anger for euer.</p>
               <p>Truely, here is a great fayth, and a greate truſte whiche we oughte to haue, when we be perſuaded, that God is ours, that is, that god wilbe meeke, pityfull, gentle, &amp; ſlowe to take vengeance, whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe by none other meanes, but that god is a father, no enemie, nor tyraunt.</p>
               <p>Now, if he be a father, then is he moſt louyng vnto his children. For how can any indignation, diſdayne, or any reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging affection continue long in the fathers mynde toward his children?</p>
               <p>In the tyme of the law, when all thinges were terrible and fearefull, then did the wrath of God ſeeme to haue none end. But when the ſonne of god came, then would god the father haue all goodnes, all clemencie, all gentlenes to be in him, and to come with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Regen uit nos in ſpem viuam:</hi> He begat vs agayne to a liuely hope. This phraſe of ſpeakyng hath a greater energie, then if he ſhould haue ſayd, he hath reſtored lyfe agayne vnto vs. For this worde regeneratyng and begettyng agayne doth admoniſhe and put vs in minde of our infirmitie and miſerie. Adam begat vs, but that was vnto death. For by nature we be the children of wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therfore, they had neede to be regenerate and borne agayne, whiche would be the children and heires of god. And thys begettyng agayne doth god the father worke in them whiche beleue in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Per reſurrectionem Ieſu Chriſti ex mortuis.</hi> It foloweth, by the reſurrection of Ieſu Chriſt from the deade. Here Peter ſheweth the maner and the waye howe we be renued and borne agayne vnto the hope of immortall lyfe. Truly euen by this (ſayth Peter) that god rayſed hys ſonne agayne from death. The reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt doth comprehende the whole myſterie of Chriſte. For by Chriſte hys reſurrection it is declared to the whole worlde, that ſinne is clenſed and put awaye. For, excepte the Lorde had clenſed and put awaye ſinne, death, whiche is the rewarde and price of ſinne, had preuayled agaynſte vs. But the Lorde dyed and is ryſen agayne. Therefore he hath put awaye both death and ſinne: not that they bee not, but that they cannot hurte the faithfull, whiche learne and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7195:335"/> beleue by the lyuelye reſurrection of Chriſte, that the lyfe eternall is prepared for them.</p>
               <p>To make the matter more playne, no man can beleue in God, without a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne meane, and middle. Therfore, when we would appeare before god, or call vpon hym, we haue neede of ſome other, whiche may ſolicite our cauſe &amp; reconcile vs to God. Nowe, there is none other meane and middle, but onely Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therfore, the fayth of the Turkes, and the Iewes, is no true fayth. And where they beleue and confeſſe, that God is the maker of heauen and earth: euen ſo doth the deuil beleue, but it doth nothyng auayle hym. No more doth theyr fayth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite them, becauſe they preſume to come into the ſyght of God without Chriſte, whiche is the true and onely mediatour, as Paule ſayth to the Romaynes:<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſlum habemus ad Deum in fide, non per noſmetipſos, ſed per Chriſtum:</hi> We haue acceſſe vnto god in fayth, not by our ſelues, but by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when we go to god, we muſte bryng Chriſte with vs, we muſt come by hym, and ſatiſfye god by him, and to do all thynges with god by hym and in hys name. And this is it that Peter here ſayth: <hi>Per reſurrectionem Ieſu Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti:</hi> That is, becauſe Chriſte is ryſen agayne, is aſcended into heauen, and ſitteth at the ryght hande of the father. For, he aſcended for thys cauſe, for to ſende and to geue vs hys holy ſpirite, by the whiche we beyng borne agayne, myght be bolde to come to god, and ſaye: O father, beholde, I am come before thee, and do praye vnto thee, not that I haue any confidence and truſte in my prayer, but becauſe my Lorde Chriſte doth make interceſſion for me: he is myne aduocate, he is myne atturney, he hath ſuffered death for me, and hath receaued vpon hym for my cauſe both ſinne, death, and hell: he is ryſen agayne, and hath vanquyſhed all myne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes: he hath purchaſed for me the hope of eternall lyfe. Therefore, when I come to thee, O God, I muſt needes bryng Chriſt with me, or elles I come vnworthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or elles I come in vayne. Awaye, therefore, you Papiſtes, awaye with your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion vnto Sainctes, with your workes of ſupererogation,<note place="margin">6. Purgarory</note> with your pipyng Purgatorie, and ſuche other lyke traſhe. I tell you, that neither remiſſion of ſinnes, nor the fauour of God, nor eternall lyfe and ſaluation can be obteyned by none other meanes, but by Chriſt: and that (I ſay) by Chriſt onely.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue playnely opened vnto you the texte of Sainte Peter before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed. Nowe will I deſcende to the ſeconde parte, that is, to the intreatie of Chriſtes diuinitie.</p>

For in theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we ſee the one to be ſo produced and brought forth of the other, and ſo to be perpetually annexed together, that neyther one can be without the other, neyther reteine nor holde his proper nature. For, how ſhal the ſunne be without bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or how ſhall there be brightneſſe, vnleſſe ther be a ſunne from which it may come? Or from whence can heate come, but from fire, or from ſome other thing not far diſtante from the ſubſtantial qualitie of fire? Therfore like as the natural qualities are together which their ſubiectes from whome they come, and doo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſhewe from whence they come: ſo in the onelye begotten ſonne of God we muſt vnderſtand, that not onely he is with the father, but alſo he is beleued to be in the father, not ſtraunge from the nature nor inferior to the father by nature, but is with him, and of him after the maner of an vnſpekeable generation.</p>
                     <p>Thus I haue brought you ſufficient teſtimonies for the proofe of Chriſts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie: and now wil I procede to the third parte, which ſhalbe to eſtabliſhe with ſtrong arguments and reaſons that Chriſt was a very true and naturall man, ſinne only excepted.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt boke of Moyſes God ſaide vnto the ſerpente: I wil put enmitye betwene thee and the woman,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 3. 11.

Who knoweth not the head of the ſerpent to be the kyngdome, the might, and the power of the deuil? And all the ſcripture doth teſtifie, that Chriſt (who was called the ſeede of the woman) hath vanquiſhed and ouercome this mightie tirannie of the ſaid ſerpent. And Chriſt is properly called <hi>ſèmen,</hi> for the veritie of the humaine nature. But he is called the ſeede of a woman, not of man, by the reaſon he was conceiued of the holy Ghoſt, without the ſeede of man.</p>
                     <p>The like promiſe was renued and inculked vnto Abraham, <hi>In ſemine tuo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicentur omnes gentes orbis:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Geneſ. 22</note> In thy ſeede ſhalbe bleſſed all the nations of the worlde. Saint Paule to the Galathians doth ſay: This ſeede of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the which we obteine bleſſednes, is Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Apoſtle in the epiſtle to the Hebrues doth write, that Chriſt toke not vpon him the nature of Aungels,<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> but he toke the ſeede of Abraham. By naming the Aungels, he excludeth all ſpiritual ſubſtaunces. By the ſeede of Abraham, he vnderſtandeth the very ſubſtance of mans fleſhe.</p>
                     <p>The ſcripture doth deduce the line and progenie of Chriſt out of the loynes of Abraham vnto Iacob, and out of him into Iuda, and ſo again vnto Dauid, vnto whom the promis of the ſonne of God was again renued. Nathan ſaid vnto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid: Thus the Lorde ſaith: when thy dayes be fulfilled, thou ſhalte ſleepe with thy fathers,<note place="margin">12.

                     <p>Apollinarius did attribut a ſoule vnto Chriſt, but toke away that part which is called <hi>mens,</hi> denieng it to be a reaſonable ſoule.<note place="margin">14. Mens.

                     <p>The Lorde ſayth in the goſpel of Mathew: the ſonne of man came to geue his ſoule a redemption for many. And Chriſt himſelf ſaid: <hi>triſtis eſt anima mea vſque ad mortem:</hi> my ſoule is heauie, euen to death.</p>
                     <p>Again in Iohn be ſaith: my ſoule is now troubled. Now, if this ſoule of Chriſt had ben deſtitute of that part, which is called <hi>mens:</hi> how could he be ſad, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, deſire and remember?</p>
                     <p>Chriſt ſaith in ſ. Luke, the ſonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came not to deſtroie the ſoules of men, but to ſaue them.

                     <p>To conclude for both the natures of Chriſt, the holy fathers fighting againſt heretiques, which denied, ether the humain nature or the diuine nature of Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:7195:339"/> or els the coniunction of both natures in one perſon, tooke their arguments of the natural maner of the Euchariſte.</p>
                     <p>If Chriſt had come vnto vs onely in the diuine nature, and had no humaine fleſhe, but phantaſtical, what communion and felowſhip had ben betwen vs and Chriſt? Sainct Paule interpreting theſe wordes: <hi>Ego &amp; pueri, quos dedit mihi Deus,</hi> beholde, here am I and the children, which god hath geuen me, ſaith thus: For aſmuche then as the children were partakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likewiſe tooke part with them.</p>
                     <p>If they take awaye the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, then they do berieue vs alſo of the ſpiritual meate, which we apprehend and take by faith.

And ſo his fleſhe and bloud ſhould haue nothyng preuailed to our inſtauration &amp; redemption. For, although the whole matter of heauenly lyfe to be geuen vnto vs, was executed by the fleſh of Chriſt: yet it did depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d only of the diuine nature. Nor it had ben any great matter to haue had any communion or felowſhip with the fleſhe of a bare and mere man. For, we haue that naturallie with all men, but if doth nothing profit.

                           <hi>Nemo negat qui in id quod minus eſt, ab eo quod maius eſt benedictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem accipiat,</hi> that is: No man doth denie, but that which is leſſer, doth take benediction of that whiche is greater. In this place ſainct Paule ſpeaketh of Melchiſedech and Abraham, and ſheweth that Abraham as leſſer, tooke bleſsyng of Melchiſedech as the greater. VVe muſt not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande nor thincke, concernyng this benediction, that Melchiſedech being a holy and wiſe man did vſe croſsyng and bleſsing with ſaying of certaine wordes vpon the heade of Abraham, but ſome other matter far from that kind of bleſsing is meant by the Apoſtle. For this benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a ſolemne precation wherewith he that was indued with ſome publique and notable honour did commende priuate men vnto god. This benediction which Paul doth make mention, is the ſymbole of ſome great power. As Iſaacke bleſſed his ſonne Iacob. And as Iacob himſelf bleſſed his nephews Ephraim and Manaſses. This benediction was not mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that the ſonne likewiſe ſhould geue the ſame benediction to the father. But the authoritie of the greater is required to geue this benediction, which may well appere out of that place of the booke of <hi>Numeri,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> where it is written, that afterwards it was commaunded to the prieſte to bleſse the people. A promiſe was added forthwith that they ſhould be bleſsed of god whom the prieſt bleſsed. And it is rather to be called and iudged the benediction of god, then of man. For as the prieſt doth ſupplie the roume of Chriſt in offring ſacrifices: So he was in bleſsinge the people no other thinge but the miniſter, meſsenger and delegate of the high God.<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> And that which Luke reherſed is to be taken in the ſame ſenſe, wher it is ſaid that Chriſt liftinge vp his handes did bleſse the Apoſtles. This maner of liftyng vp the handes was borrowed of the prieſtes of the olde lawe, that Chriſt might ſhewe himſelf to be the ſame perſon, by whome God the father doth bleſse vs.</p>

Firſt for the miſtery of oure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, for Chriſt is the Lord of all the elect, whome he chalenged and deliuered from the power and dominion of Sathan, ſinne, and death, and made them vnto him a proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he is called <hi>Dominus,</hi> Lorde for his diuine power and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the whiche all thinges are ſubiecte vnto the ſonne of God. Paule writyng to the Corinthians doth ſaye. <hi>Licet multi ſunt domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, nobis tamen vnus eſt dominus Ieſus Chriſtus, per quem omnia &amp; nos per illum,</hi> that is: Although there be manye Lords, yet vnto vs there is but one Lord, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whome al things are, and we are alſo by hym. It litle auayleth the Arrians to boaſt that Paule doth not cal Chriſt God, but lord, as though the diuinitie were to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed onelye to the father. But if Chriſte be onely the one Lorde (as ſainct Paule calleth hym) he ſhall alſo be God, vnles he will exclude the father from dominion and bearyng rule. For as Chriſte
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7195:341"/> is onely one Lord, and yet doth not depoſe the father, from bearyng rule with him, So the father is onelye one God, and doth not ſeparate the ſon from the diuine nature.

                     <p>Becauſe I haue made mention of this place, of Paule, I will examine the wordes and mynde of Paule throughlie, what he meant by theſe wordes, <hi>Idolum nihil eſt in mundo.</hi> Chriſoſtome writeth that Paul was wraped in a narrowe ſtraite on both the ſides, for of one ſide he woulde reſtraine the Corinthians that they ſhould not eate of the meates offred to idols. On the other ſide he ſemed to graunt that idolles had no diuine power, eyther to ſanctifie meates offred to them, or els to pollute them. Vvhiche ſeme two contraries. For if thoſe meates be forbidden to be eaten whiche are offred to idolles, it ſemeth that they ſhould take ſome vncleanes of the idols, whiche by theyr owne nature they haue not: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was greate impietie for men, eyther to touche them, or to taſte them. Againe if nothynge came vnto them by reaſon they were offred, then was it indifferent, eyther to vſe them, or not to vſe them.</p>
                     <p>To this, aunſwere may thus be made. Amonge the Corinthians there
<pb facs="tcp:7195:342"/> were two ſortes of men. The one were dull, ignoraunt and blunt. The other were of a quick, ſharpe, and pregnant witte. The duller ſorte thought that ther was ſome thinge in the Idols which had in it ſom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or diuine power. The wiſer ſort thought and reaſoned that Idols were nothing els but ſtones and wood, hauinge nothynge in them either to make good or bad, meates offred vnto them, and therfore tooke them as <hi>Adiaphora,</hi> things indifferent. Now Paul is compaſſed about with theſe two kyndes of men.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he graunted that which they affirmed, which was that an idol is nothing in the worlde. Vvhiche is not to be taken or vnderſtande as touchinge the matter. For no man doubteth but that ſtones, woode, Iuerye, ſiluer, gold and braſſe be ſomwhat in the worlde. But the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Paule muſt be vnderſtand concernyng the artificiall imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And then idols are to be ſet among thoſe thinges which do ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie. And the nature of thoſe things which are conferred together is ſuch, that if you take awaye one, you muſt take awaye the other alſo. As when the ſonne doth ceaſe, then the father alſo ceaſeth to be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And theſe be <hi>relatiua.</hi> And that an idole perteineth to the nature of relatiues: Tertullian declareth in his booke <hi>De Idolatria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe wordes <hi>In mundo,</hi> in the world, are well added. For in the mindes and toughtes of fooliſh men an idole may be ſomwhat: But in the nomber of true and ſubſtantiall thinges which were created of God, an idole is nothyng. Vvhen heretiques profeſſe and worſhippe God, not as he is himſelf, but as it pleaſeth their phantaſie, then they make an idole to them ſelues. And as the other materiall idols be groſſe and externe: ſo theſe idols of the minde be ſpirituall and interne.</p>

As for example: if any do make the forme and ſhape of a fourefooted beaſt, or of a ſerpente, or of a birde in the metall of golde or ſiluer, or wood or ſtone, and doth ſet it vp to be worſhipped, he doth not make an idol, but a ſimilitude.

                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:7195:342"/>
                     <p>He maketh an idole whiche maketh that whiche is not according to the Apoſtles ſaying, An Idole is nothing. VVhat is that whiche is not? ſome forme and ſhape whiche the eye neuer ſawe, but the mynde doth faine and imagine it. For example: if any will ſhape to the partes of man a Dogge or a Rammes head, or would fayne in one mans body to be two faces, or would put the hinder part of an horſe or of a fiſh to the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parte of mans body: He I ſay that imagineth and maketh theſe or ſuche lyke thynges, he maketh not a ſimilitude, but an idole. For he maketh that which is not, nor is like to it ſelfe in any part. And therfore the Apoſtle knowing theſe things, doth ſay: <hi>Idolum nihil eſt in mundo.</hi> For there is no ſhape taken or made of things that be extant. But there is onely that whiche an idle and curious minde hath inuented. That the true God cannot nor ought to be expreſsed or faſhioned with ſhapes and ſimilitudes, it is euidently commaunded and declared in <hi>Deuteronomio,</hi> and for that cauſe there was no image of no ſexe or any other thing ſene in the mount Horeb.</p>

So that from thence none could come vnto Abraham.

And when Abraham did affirme that the could receiue no helpe neither of him nor of Lazarus, what boldenes hath the prieſt to ſaye that he by his maſſe and prayers can releaſe the ſoules of the dead from the paines of purgatorie.

Here is alſo mention made onely of them, which markyng and obſeruing the foundation, do builde. Among whome they are not to be nombred which are burthened with deſperat vices. Sainct Auſtine goeth further and ſaith, that the foundation is Chriſt, which the Apoſtle himſelfe doth interpret. He addeth alſo fayth, becauſe Chriſt dwelleth in our harts by faith, and he maketh them to be the good builders, which obey the lawe of God. He affirmeth them to builde haye and ſtuble, which reteine the pleaſures of the worlde, which pleaſures are not expreſſely forbydden, and do ſo reteine them, that they geue them ſelues more vnto them, then equitie doth require. They which build wel (ſaith he) poſſeſſe the goods of this world, as riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, wife, familie, and yet they be as though they poſseſſe them not, and do vſe them, as though they would not vſe them. The ill builders are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with theſe things more then behoueth, yet they geue not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo loſelye vnto theſe their deſires, that they will preferre theſe goods, before Chriſt, vnto whom as vnto the foundation they do lean, but rather ſet Chriſt before them. For if they come eyther to confeſsion of their ſaith, or to martirdome, they will rather loſe thoſe goods, than to depart from Chriſt. Notwithſtandyng becauſe they did embrace them with to vehement affect and loue in loſing them, they feele the fire. For they be very ſorowful, and take it greuouſly that theſe things are taken
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7195:350"/> from them, but yet they be ſaued, becauſe they kepe the foundation of the true faith ſafe and vnhurt, that is (ſaith he) haie, wood, and chaf to be kindled with fire and periſh, becauſe their deſires and pleaſures doth moleſte them, as the flame of fire would do, and ſo thoſe pleaſures and affections do vaniſhe awaye. And this happeneth to many (ſaith he) while they liue here. For it chaunceth many times, that the holy martirs and ſaints be beriued of the goods of this world for the name of Chriſt. He proueth fire to ſignifie tribulations, as it is taken in the pſalme.<note place="margin">Pſal. 65.</note> And for that cauſe be willed fire and water to be had in the exorciſme of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, that we may be admoniſhed that by theſe two we ſhalbe tried. He bringeth in alſo this ſentence of Eccleſiaſticus: <hi>Vas figuli probat fornax, at animos iuſtorum tentatio tribulationis:</hi> the fornace proueth the potters veſsell, but tentation of tribulation, trieth the mindes of the righteous.</p>
                        <p>To this interpretation of Auguſtin, Gregorie doth conſent, yet he doth wreſt it vnto purgatorie. But it doth moſt euidently appeare, that Paul by the good and bad buildings, doth ſignifie doctrine, eyther ſounde or els corrupt, whoſe end is deſcribed, that if they be good, they ſhal haue re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward, but if they be ill, they ſhall periſh and vaniſh awaye. For euery plant which my father hath not planted (ſaith Chriſt) ſhalbe pulled vp by the rootes, but the word of God remaineth for euer.</p>
                        <p>He which hath not buylded well, may be ſaued, but yet by fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhal ſee his doctrine confuted &amp; condemned, &amp; ſhal know that he hath laboured in vaine, and be like vnto one which goeth through the fire, whoſe garments are burned, yet he himſelf eſcapeth. Some do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this clauſe (ſo as it wer by fire) becauſe men are hardly brought from their opinions. For they do embrace and allow to much their owne inuentions. But the expoſition is more ſimple and plain, if you wyll ſay that theſe men, when god ſhal examine them, ſhal fele ſhame, ſadnes, and vnquiet conſciences. And to this interpretation doth Ambroſe condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, he muſt needs be aſhamed which ſeeth himſelf to haue defended a falſity for a trouth: in this examination and iudgement of God the error of doctrine is opened, and forthwith followeth dolor and great heauines of repsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Chriſoſtom thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this fire pertaineth to hel, but becauſe he ſeeth this ſayinge to be againſt him (but he ſhalbe ſaued as it were by fire) he expounded to be ſaued, to ſignify no other thing, then to endure &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinu, not to be extinct, not to be turned into aſhes, or to be brought to nothinge, that this euil builder ſhoulde endure <hi>quo ad ſubſtantiam,</hi> concerning his ſubſtance, but hee ſhall not be reſerued (as he ſayth) but only to puniſhment, that he burn in this fire for euer. He did know that this interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſomwhat farre fetched, and therefore he wente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:7195:351"/> to temper it, and ſheweth that Paul ſomtimes adourneth with fair wordes thoſe things, which otherwiſe are vnhoneſt and to be diſproued, and ſomtimes termeth with vnhoneſt woordes things that be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and allowable: In the later Epiſtle to the Corinthes Paule ſaith, that we do captiuate all our thoughtes wherby this worde captiuat, he calleth it to be a perſuaſion, by the which men do willyngly ſubmit them ſelues to the faith of Chriſt. Alſo when he ſpeaketh of the mortification of the fleſh and members, which are vpon the earth, he commendeth by this terme (mortification) a very approued and perfect thing, And likewiſe when he ſaith to the Romaines. <hi>Non regnet peccatum in veſtro mortale corpore:</hi> Let not ſinne reigne in your mortall bodies: he doth beautifie with this worde (kyngdom) tyrannie, by the whiche we are oppreſſed with ſinne: ſo by this worde (ſauing) he calleth it and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth eternall continuaunce in the fire of hell. But this wreſtinge and writhing of Chriſoſtome to defend his interpretation, can not conſiſt as a thyng true. For when all things here are taken allegoricallie, what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth he to flie the ſignification of a true fire, vnleſſe he meaneth the fire of hell to be alſo allegoricall, which the receiued doctrine of the churche will neither admitte nor ſuffer?</p>
                        <p>Furthermore when it is ſaid, the fire ſhall proue euerie mans worke, it behoueth to conſtitute ſuch a fire, whiche aſwell the good builders as ill, ſhal ſuſteine and feele, as ſainct Auguſtine very aptly doth write.</p>
                        <p>I thincke Saincte Auguſtine neither mente nor woulde, good and holye men to be tormented with the fire of hell. Notwitſtandynge the Greeke ſcholies do receiue this ſentence and interpretation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome.</p>
                        <p>Eraſmus in his annotations doth count it a vaine and fooliſh thing by this place to proue purgatorie. If the fire of purgatorie be in this place conſtitute and proued, then muſt this fire be common aſwell to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and to other ſaincts, as to other, although they haue builded a church with moſt approued and ſincere doctrine. And by this place to defende purgatorie, is no more but that our aduerſaries do caſt doung in their owne eies. For they ſay that ſome pardons are geuen and graunted of the pope to abſolue man when he dieth, <hi>ab omni tam poena, quam cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> aſwel from all payn, as from all faulte: ſo that his ſoule ſhall flie ſtraight waye into heauen. If it be ſo, how ſhall this man be proued with the fire of purgatorie, if this fire be common to all?</p>
                        <p>Scotus doth ſay that the action and motion of charitie may be found ſo abſolute and perfect, and of ſo great feruencie, that it may put away all paines How then can this fire of purgatorie which they will proue by this place, be common to all? vnles perchaunce they will place this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7195:351"/> fire in the ayre, and faigne that all ſainctes when they flie to heauen, do paſse through this fire: as one Altuinus did affirme.</p>
                        <p>But it is to be marked that the opinion of them which will haue a purgatorie, is not one, but diuerſe and ſondrie. For ſome woulde haue it to be a moſt certain doctrine, and one of the articles of our faith, other do but ſuſpicate or opinate that ther is ſuch a place.</p>
                        <p>Concernyng the firſt, ſure doctrine, and the articles of our faith, ought to be proued with moſt euident teſtimonies of the ſcriptures. Their iudgement is not to be receyued which would make men to be the authours of things to be beleued. For contumelie ſhould be done to the holy ghoſt, if it ſhould be thought that he had geuen vnto vs thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges in the whiche ſhould not be perfectly contained whatſoeuer is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsarie to ſaluation.</p>
                        <p>The Epiſtle written to Timothie doth ſufficiently conuince them, where it is written that the ſcriptures geuen by the inſpiration of God is profitable to teach, to confute, to correct, and to inſtruct, that the man of God may be perfecte, and abſolut to all good workes: Vvherfore if they will bring any good worcke, or any thing neceſſary to be beleued, which can not be confirmed by the holy ſcriptures, it is to be anſwered, that which they bring, is neither good, nor profitable. And where they boaſt that the Apoſtles taught not al things, nor that the primatiue chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che receiued not all things neceſsary to ſaluation, it is not to be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted.</p>

                        <p>But it is to be tought that this maketh gretly againſt this comment and gloſe of purgatorie, that the holye ſcriptures make no mention of ſuch a place, neither in the olde Teſtament, nor in the new.</p>

                        <p>Paule alſo when occaſion was offred him in writynge to the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians (for he intreated how they ſhould mourne and lamente for the dead in funeralles, and he lifteth vp and comforteth them that he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed onely by the hope of the reſurrection:) might at the leaſt haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed in that place to haue praied for our dere frends, leaſte they ſhould lye long in the paines of purgatorie.</p>
                        <p>He bringeth no ſuch thing, but after the doctrine of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſaith. <hi>Itaque inuicem conſolemini verbis iſtis:</hi> Therfore comfort your ſelues one an other with theſe wordes.</p>
                        <p>Dioniſius called Areopagita, when of a ſet purpoſe, he moued a queſtion, why the Miniſter of the church, doth praye for him that is dead, maketh no mention of purgatorie, but greatly trauaileth to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre other cauſes and reaſons. If he had beleued a purgatorie, he might eaſely haue anſwered the queſtion.</p>
                        <p>Sainct Ciprian in the end of his booke doth write <hi>Quum hinc excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum fuerit, neque locus poenitentiae, neque ſatisfactionis erit effectus:</hi> Vvhen we departe from hence, ther ſhalbe neither place of repentaunce, nor effecte of ſatiſfaction.</p>
                        <p>Our aduerſaries were wonte to pretende for this opinion, mercie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not thincke them to be condemned whiche died in the confeſſion of Chriſte, when notwithſtandyng, they wer yet holden wyth ſom ſpot of ſinne.</p>

                        <p>Thus you perceiue that purgatorie is no neceſsarie doctrine to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued. Againe, the ſuſpition and opinion therof doth leane vpon infirme and weake reaſons, and doth hurte pietie, rather then promote it.</p>

                        <p>It can not be denied but that the church hath ſo done. But this their doing or ſaying hath none authoritie out of the holy ſcriptures. Men be moued and as it were impelled with a certaine naturall loue towarde their frindes that be dead, to wiſhe them well to doe, and to breake out ſometime into prayers for them. But heede is to be taken that this affection be not diſsonant vnto faith.</p>
                        <p>Other cauſes beſide the opinion of purgatorie maye be aſsigned and alledged why prayers were made in the church for the dead.</p>
                        <p>They would not haue the name and memorie of their frends depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to periſhe and to be extinguiſhed, but tooke great care that it might long continue among the faithfull.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore thoſe prayers pertained to geuinge of thankes vnto God, who hath called them that are departed vnto himſelfe out of this miſerable world. Vvherupon ſainct Ambroſe in his funerall orations, which he had at the death of Theodoſius and Valentinianus the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, doth reioice that they had alredie obteined eternall felicitie, and that they reigned with Chriſt: yet notwithſtandyng he prayed that God woulde geue vnto them that reſt, which they deſired, whiche two things ſeme to be repugnaunt, vnles you will expounde prayers for than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes geuyng.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, ſome of the fathers wente ſo far, that they thought prayers ſomwhat to profit them that were in hell, not in ſhortning their plaines, for they be eternall, but to diminiſh and eaſe them at the leaſt for the tyme of the praiers.</p>
                        <p>Chriſoſtome, Auguſtine, and Hierome ſeme to be of that minde.</p>
                        <p>Againe ſome might ſeme to praye for the dead, not for the ende to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them from purgatorie, but that Chriſt might the ſooner come to iudge the quicke and the dead, that the faithful which died in the Lord, might the ſooner haue the fruition of felicitie, both of the bodye and the ſoule.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, other did praie for the dead whiche were not in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, (for they beleued it not) but in paradiſe,<note place="margin">De monoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</note> as it appeareth in Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, who writeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the church was wont to pray for the martirs, for

                        <p>Thoſe prayers therfore were nothing els but thankes geuing. For they rendred thankes vnto God for the great gifts and benefites graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them of god, by the which they did moſt gloriouſly triumph ouer their ennemies, they did alſo ſtirre and comforte other to be theyr followers.

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Hodie</hi> doth not ſignify this preſent day or to morrow, but perpetuity of time, or from the beginning of the world, as in the epiſtle to the Hebrues, Paule doth vſe it ſaying: <hi>Ieſus Chriſtus heri,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>et hodie i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem eſt etiam in ſecula.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt yeſterday and to day, the ſame alſo is for euer. Notwithſtanding this ſentence of Paule is of diuers, diuerſly expounded.</p>
                     <p>Some do write that Paul bringeth in here an argument to confirme faith and truſt in God, in them to whom he wrote.</p>
                     <p>One might obiect and ſay: Paul thou dooſt wel admoniſh vs. God did aboue meaſure fauour the Apoſtles and apoſtolike men, as his chief dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and friendes, but he will not embrace me, with the like fauour and grace. To the which obiection Paul geueth an apt and mete anſwer, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Ieſus Chriſt yeſterday and to day, and the ſame for euer. As though he ſhould haue ſayd. Ieſus Chriſt, which was yeſterday, that is in tyme paſt, that ſame is to day, and ſhall continue for euer. He hath that ſame benignity and gentlenes which he had then. His handes are not abbreui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated nor ſhortened. He which ſuſteyned and nouriſhed with meate and drinke Elias, and the people of Iſrael, by the ſpace of fourty yeares, the ſame will alſo nouriſh and feede you: doubtles if hys benignity and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes ſhould ceaſe, he ſhould alſo ceaſe to be God. Other do referre thys ſentence to Paul, to this end, that we ſhould know that ſame manner of ſaluation to haue bene before Chriſt was incarnate, and the ſame which is after the incarnation of Chriſt to be all one. Other do referre it to the
<pb facs="tcp:7195:355"/> doctrine of Chriſt, and that this word ſhal remaine for euer. Vvhich ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, although they be godly: yet in my iudgement the firſt expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the very natural ſenſe of the place.</p>
                     <p>And note here one thing, that the Apoſtle doth not entreate of the diuine eſſence of Chriſt, but of the knowledge of him, which flooriſhed alwaies among the godly, and is the perpetual foundation of the church.</p>
                     <p>Therfore this ſentence muſt be referred, not to the eſſence, but to the quality (if we may ſo ſay.)</p>
                     <p>Nor Paule diſputeth here whither Chriſt were eternal with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but what manner of knowledge and benignitye was among men of him, and from him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Hodie,</hi> is properly vſed to be ſpoken of that time, which is after the comming of Chriſt, as Paule vſeth it to the Hebrues ſaying: <hi>Hodie, ſi vocem eius audieritis,</hi> To day if ye heare his voyce.</p>

                        <hi>Heſichius in Leuiticum,</hi> doth vſe <hi>Hodie,</hi> for eternity and perpetuity, alledging theſe words of the ſecond pſalme: <hi>Ego hodie genui te.</hi> This day I begat thee, that is, <hi>ab eterno,</hi> from euer and eternallye. For with God <hi>heri, &amp; cras</hi> haue no place. Ther is alwaies with him a continual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Hodie,</hi> as Theophilactus writeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the epiſtle to the Hebrues.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding ſome learned men which be of great iudgement write vpon theſe words (<hi>Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te:</hi> thou art my ſonne, this day haue I begot thee) after this maner. Ther be, ſay they, diuers kindes of ſonnes, ſome are children by nature, ſome by adoption, ſome of regeneration, ſome of alteration, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which the priſtinate ſtate and condition is chaunged into a new ſtate. As touching Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, the true Chriſtians be not ignoraunt by what kind of theſe ſonnes he is the ſonne of God. Our faith doth beleue him to be the naturall, the onely begotten and conſubſtantial ſonne of the father.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this preſent place of ſcripture, let vs ſee how this agreeth vnto Chriſt, that the father did not ſimply ſay I begat thee, but this day I begat thee. This phraſe doth not agree vnto children of adoption, of age, or of loue, but onely of the ſonnes of generation, that is, that be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
                     <p>Now this generation is three fold.</p>

                     </list>
                     <p>The naturall generation is, by the which God the father begat the woord, and hys natural and conſubſtantial ſonne, and by the which one man begetteth an other.</p>
                     <p>The ſpirituall generation is, by the which the myndes of men are ſo
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7195:355"/> regenerate, that of wicked they be made godly. Of the which generation Paul ſpeaketh in the Epiſtle to the Corinthians, ſaying: <hi>In Chriſto Ieſu per euangelium vos genui.</hi> I haue begot you in Ieſus Chriſt by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Agayne, <hi>filioli quos iterum parturio.</hi> My litle children, with whom again I trauel with child.</p>
                     <p>Conditional generation is, by the which man is chaunged into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate and condition, diuers and diſcrepant from his former ſtate, as if one of a priuat ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be made a king, one from an obſcure &amp; baſe calling is made noble and honorable, of mortal, is made immortal.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe wordes, <hi>Hodie genui te,</hi> this day I begat thee, doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to Chriſt, according to the firſt generation. Yet not ſo, but that he is the natural ſonne of God, nor that this generation being eternall, can be made temporal, or ſubiect to any time, except ye wil referre it to that day, in the which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word being incarnate, was born of the virgin Mary.</p>
                     <p>Neither the generation which is called ſpirituall, maye agree vnto Chriſt, for when he is and was moſt pure in minde, he had none impiety nor vnpurenes, from the which he might be regenerate vnto godlynes. But the third generation, that is the condicional, may be applied &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferred to Chriſt. For what other thing was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> imutation &amp; chaung of the ſtate and condicion of Chriſt, when he was by the holy ghoſt dedicated, conſecrated, and declared from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the ſonne of God, at the floud Iordan, when he was baptiſed: But a certaine regeneration, that is, he was ſene to be another maner of man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was before? In ſo much that the inhabitauntes of the city did ſay: <hi>Vnde huic haec omnia, &amp; quae ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia haec quae data eſt illi? &amp;c.</hi> From whence hath he theſe thinges? what wiſedome is this that is geuen vnto hym, that euen ſuch great woorkes are done by his handes? Is not this the carpenter Maries ſonne? The bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Iames and Ioſes, and of Iuda and Simon?</p>
                     <p>Or ells theſe wordes. <hi>Ego hodie genui te.</hi> This day haue I begot thee, may he referred to Chriſt, when being rayſed from death he puttyng of the infirmity and mortalitye of our fleſh was tranſlated and exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, vnto the heauenly glorye, and to the right hand of the Father. This is the cenſure and iudgement of certain learned diuines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hodie</hi> is taken alſo for euery time, or dayly tyme, as we aſke in the Lordes prayer, <hi>panem noſtrum quotidianum da nobis hodie,</hi> Geue vs this day our dayly bread.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hodie</hi> ſignifieth ſomtime the whole time of our life, as Baſilius Mag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nus writeth in a certain Epiſtle,<note place="margin">In epiſtola ad Chilonem de vita ſolit.</note> where he bringeth in this ſaying of the Apoſtle: <hi>Inuicem adhortamini, et in id ipſum aedificate vſquequo hodie dicitur.</hi> Exhorte one another dayly, while it is called to day.</p>

                  <p>In this worlde there is a tyme to exerciſe and practiſe godlines.

And then ſhall we ſuſteine no labour, no affliction, no paſſions, but ſhal haue eternall reſt, wherof Chriſt gaue a taſte vnto his diſciples in the mounte Thabor.

                  <p>Now, Peter buildeth vpon the foundation, which he hath layd, a noble edifice of patience, ſaying: <hi>in quo exultatis:</hi> in which you reioyce, that is, be glad, exalte, and reioice in the hope of this ſaluation laid vp in heauen. He doth not here one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayſe them, but alſo exhorte, and comfort them.

But the faythfull themſelues do know better by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, that theſe two contrarye affectes doo conſiſte together in them, than canne be expreſſed with wordes. For the faythfull are not ſtockes and blocks, nor haue not ſo put of humayn ſenſe and feling, but that they be touched with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and ſorow, but that they feare perils and daungers, but that they fele what a greuous thing pouerty is, and how ſharpe and hard perſecutions be, yea and fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thermore do apprehend what tears,<note place="margin">9 Peſtilence.</note> what ſicknes, what cares, what coldes, what ſterility and barenneſſe, what peſtilence, what hunger doo chaunce in the whole life of man, and that aduerſity (which is thought to haue this day an ende) begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth again to morrow. So that in this life be it neuer ſo long, there ſemeth little life or comfort. Of theſe euels the faythfull perceiue and feele heauines, but yet this heauines is ſo mitigat by faith, that the faithful notwithſtanding ceaſe not to reioyce: ſo that ſorow doth not hynder their ioy, but rather geue place vnto it. On the other ſide, althoughe ioye do ouercome ſadnes, yet it doth not vtterly aboliſh it, becauſe it doth not beriue vs of our humayne nature.</p>
                  <p>It foloweth, <hi>Si opus ſit:</hi> If nede require. This ſaying of Peter is ful of comfort, if the matter ſo requyre, if it do tend to our ſaluation, god will ſhortly fyniſh theſe afflictions and tentations.<note place="margin">10.

And God doth not afflicte and trouble vs, but for the beſt: <hi>Si opus ſit:</hi> If neede require. Peter putteth here the condition, for the cauſe, for he ſheweth that it is not without cauſe, that God doth ſo exerciſe &amp; trye hys. For if he ſhould afflicte vs for no cauſe, it would be very grieuous to beare and to ſuffer. Peter therfore doth take here an argument of conſolation out of the counſell and decree of God: Not that the reaſon and cauſe may alway appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs,<note place="margin">11. If God will ſo.</note> but that we ſhould be reſolued and fullie perſwaded, that it ought ſo to be, becauſe it pleaſeth God. And therfore Peter doth ſay: <hi>Si opus ſit,</hi> If nede requyre. Which in other words he doth after in the .3. chapter repeate, ſaying, <hi>Si ita velit deus,</hi> if God wil ſo. Which place doth make much againſt them, which laie croſſes and burthens vpon them ſelues,<note place="margin">12.

Faſtings.</note> who both gaue them ſelues to ſuch faſtinges, watchings and lying on the ground, thinking therby to enter into heauen, that they could not execute their paſtorall function and office.

                  <p>Therfore, we nede not to ſeke and to lay croſſes vpon our ſelues, but as Peter ſayth, <hi>Si opus ſit,</hi> that is, if the matter ſo require, which is: If god do appointe vnto thee that thou ſuffer, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly receiue the croſſe, and comfort thy ſelf with the

                     </gap>y may be ſincere and pure in the faith.</p>
                  <p>Faith is compared vnto gold, but fayth is much more noble then gold. For as gold is the moſt precious mettal in things mortall: ſo fayth doth moſt excell in things ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>Gold is temporal, fayth is eternall: gold is tried two maner of wayes. Firſt when it is purged by fire from the droſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly when the goodnes therof is tried by iudgement. Both theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of prouinge do moſt aptly agree vnto faith.

                  <p>Secondly experimente and iudgement is taken of vs, whether it be a fained or a ſincere fayth.</p>
                  <p>When we come vnto fayth by the worde and hearyng of the goſpell, we are iuſtified and begin to be purged, but as longe as we be in this fleſhe, we can not eſcape throughlye clean.

                  <p>But there is no loue without the knowledge of the thing loued. But you know by fayth, for fayth hath her eye, fayth hath her eare, yet ſpiritual, not carnall.

                        </gap>on, by the which we know the natures of things in them ſelues. If theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be after the naturall maner (that is to ſay, if I ſee any ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nſible thing, if I ſee by imagination any thinge that was ſeene before, if I vnderſtand any thing by phantaſie) all theſe viſions can not be called <hi>caelum.</hi> But then anye of theſe viſions is called <hi>Caelum</hi> heauen, when it is aboue the naturall facultie and power of mannes knowledge. As for example: If thou ſee anye thinge with thy corporall eyes aboue the facultie of nature,<note place="margin">Daniel 5.</note> ſo arte thou rapte and taken vnto the firſte heauen, as Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazar was rapte and taken, when he ſaw the hand of a man writynge vpon a wall. But if thou be lifte vp and taken by imagination or ſpirite, to knowe or ſee any thyng ſupernaturally, then art thou rapte and take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the ſecond heauen:<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> as Peter was rapte and taken when he ſawe the ſheete ſente downe from heauen.</p>
                     <p>But if any man do ſee things intelligible, and the natures of them not by any ſenſe or phantaſie, then he ſhould be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp vnto the third heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <p>And here is to be noted, that to be taken vp to the firſt heauen, is to be alienate from the corporall ſenſes. Vvherupon when none can
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7195:366"/> be fully and wholy abſtract and drawen from the corporal ſenſes, it can not be ſaid, that any man is taken vp <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> vnto the third heauen, but <hi>ſecundum quid:</hi> For as much as it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſomtime is ſo intent and bent vnto one ſenſe, that he is vtterly abſtract and taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the act and vſe of the other ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>To be rapt and taken vnto the ſecond heauen, is when any is alienate &amp; take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from his ſenſe, to ſee &amp; behold things by imagination. And ſuch viſions are wont to be done in extaciſes and traunſes: as Peter was in a traunce, when he ſaw the linnen cloth come downe from heauen.</p>

                     <p>Nor it is probable, that Moſes the miniſter of the old teſtament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iewes, ſhould ſee God: and that Paule the Miniſter of the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament vnto the Gentiles, ſhould be voide of the ſame gift.</p>

                     <p>Caietanus did call that third heauen the higheſt place of all: becauſe in the ſcripture ther is mencion made of three heauens.

The third and the higheſt is, wher be all the waters that are aboue the heauen, wherof the ſcripture maketh much mencion, which we doo call <hi>coelum aqueum,</hi> and the Philoſophers call it <hi>primum mobile.</hi> But <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreum caelum,</hi> which the latter writers do ſpeake of, is not mencioned in any place of the ſcripture.</p>
                     <p>Saint Auguſtine diſputeth, whether by this third heauen we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtand Paradiſe.</p>
                     <p>Lyranus affirmeth this third heauen to be the ſame that Paradiſe is, whom ſome of the later writers do follow. But the taking vp of Paul is to be vnderſtanded twoo manner of wayes, that is: he was rapt vnto the third heauen, that he might ſee the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt raigning in heauen. And he was taken vnto Paradiſe, that is, vnto the ſeate and place of the bleſſed ſpirites, Patriarches, and prophets, to the end that he might not onely ſee whether he himſelfe ſhoulde come after death, but alſo that hee might heare the miſteries of God, whereby he might returne the better inſtructed and prepared to his Apoſtleſhip.

                        <p>This is the article which Ciprian ſayde not to be had in the Romaine Symbole, no neither yet to be added in the East churches. Yea and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, although the ſymbole of the Synode holden at Nice, or of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node holden at Conſtantinople, is none other thing then a declaration of this Symbole: yet is not ther neither ſo much as any one thing that is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to this article.</p>
                        <p>Alſo the very inconcinnitye or vnhandſome ioyning or hanging toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſpeche and oration, is an euident proofe, that ther is a percell thrust in among the other articles, by ſome other man.</p>
                        <p>Theſe words, <hi>ſepultus eſt,</hi> that is, he was buried, doo belong to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which laid a ſleepe by death, doth riſe againe, that is, doth as it were waken from ſlepe. But theſe wordes, <hi>deſcendit ad inferos,</hi> that is, went down to hel: they do referre vnto the ſoule, which neither was buried, neither did riſe againe, but being departed and ſundried for a tyme, ſhortly after returned againe into the dead body.</p>
                        <p>Vvhether Thomas Aquinas did adde this article, I am in doubt. Ther is a certain ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it ſhould be added of ſome other man, or at the leaſte by this argumente, for that it is not in the mete place. For when he doth make the third article of the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he maketh the fourth article of the going downe into hel, except peraduenture he ment this, that Chriſt, after he was riſen againe from death to life, went down in body and ſoule to hel.</p>
                        <p>And an other litle worke which goeth abroade, bearing the title of Thomas Aquinas vpon the Symbol, doth interpret and declare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary therof, and vſeth alſo a contrary order. For ther the going downe to hel, goeth before the reſurrection. How be it, this ſaid Opuſcle (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a learned and an holy woorke) yet it ſeemeth not to be the worke of Thomas Aquinas.</p>
                        <p>Eraſmus ſaith alſo, that thoſe ſcriptures &amp; reaſons, which are alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to confirme this article, cannot conſtraine him which deſireth to thwart and to finde cauilations, to beleue that the ſoule of Chriſt went down by it ſelfe perſonally to hel. For the ſcriptures (ſaith he) doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times call death and the graue by this name <hi>Inferos,</hi> which ſame word is ſomtimes engliſhed hel. As for example in the booke of Geneſis: <hi>Morietur &amp; deducent famuli tui canos eius cum dolore ad inferos,</hi> that is to ſay: he ſhal die, and thy ſeruauntes ſhal bring his hoare heares with ſorow to his graue. He calleth here the aged body of Iacob, hoare heares. And by this word <hi>inferos,</hi> he ment the ſepulchre or graue. And this thing doth Saint Ciprian in few woords in a manner ſhewe, when after he had ſayd before, that this particle is not had neither in the weſt churches, nor in the Eaſt churches, he addeth afterwards theſe wordes.

<pb facs="tcp:7195:373"/> Chriſte into hell.

                        <p>And that Chriſte after this maner deſcended into hell, it is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, when that he ſuffred that death which is inflicted vpon the wicked: And truly there can be no more terribler hell, then one to feele him ſelfe forſaken and alienate from God, and not to be hearde when he calleth, as thoughe God had conſpired to his deſtruction.

                        <p>Other writers, both of great learning, and depe iudgement, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde this article in another ſenſe, who iudgeth the deſcenſe of Chriſt into hell to be nothing els, but the vertue of the death of Chriſt to haue come euen vnto the dead, and to haue proffited them, that is, that all the Patriarches and faithfull men before the comming of chriſt, be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from eternall death, through the death of Chriſt.</p>

Therfore we maye ſaye, that the ſoule of Chriſte wente downe to hell, that is, that it was brought into the boſome of Abraham, where all the faithfall departed were gathered together. Vvherfore, when Chriſt ſaid to the theefe crucified with him, this day ſhalte thou be with me in paradiſe: he promiſed him participation of life, and companie of the bleſsed ſpirits.

                        <p>Lebanriſch writeth after this maner: Sainct Peter alledgeth this ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of the prophet Dauid: <hi>Non derelinques animam meam in inferno, nec ſines ſanctum tuum videre corruptionem,</hi> that is: Thou ſhalte not leaue my ſoule in hel, neither ſhalte thou ſuffer thine holy one to ſee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. After that he had declared, that this could not be ſpoken of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid himſelfe (for that his graue remained yet among them, and his body ſuffred corruption) he addeth: foraſmuch as Dauid was a Prophet, and did know that God ſwore vnto him, that Chriſt ſhould come of the fruict of his loines, touching the fleſh, he ſpeake euidently of the reſurrection of Chriſt, becauſe his ſoule ſhould not be left in hell, nor his fleſhe ſawe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. You ſee how ſainct Peter applieth this ſentence of the Prophet to ſet forth Chriſts reſurrection. And in ſteede of this worde <hi>ſanctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eius,</hi> ſainct Peter hath <hi>carnem eius,</hi> which is to be marked. Is not reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contrary vnto death? And what other thinge is death, then the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the body from the ſoule? And what other thing then can reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection be, but a renuing and knitting together againe of the bodie and the ſoule? Sainct Peter therfore applyieng this ſentence to the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, doth (as it were) pointe with his fingers the places from whence theſe two partes ſeuered, muſte be brought again: namely the ſoule from hell, for hel could not hold it: and the bodie from the graue, that it ſhould not corrupt. <hi>Haèc Rabbi Lebanriſch.</hi>

                        <p>Thus I haue declared at large the opinions and iudgements aſwell of the olde fathers, as of the later writers, concerninge this article of the fayth: <hi>Deſcendit ad inferna,</hi> he deſcended into hell. So that euery man (as Paule ſaith) maye abounde in his owne iudgement. One thinge I would wiſhe that neither this article, nor any other conteyned in the ſymbole, commonly called <hi>Symbolum Apoſtolorum,</hi> ſhould be lightlye ſhaken of, but to be beleued as they ſtande there. As for my part, I am fullye reſolued, that this article is true: He deſcended into hell.</p>

                        <p>Peter here vnderſtandeth two kynds of temptation, the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and the temptation of our fleſhe. God tempteth vs with croſses, falſe prophets, with famine, with warre, with fire, with water, with diſeaſes, with afflictions and perſecutions, and with a thouſand kindes of aduerſities, that he may trie our faith, whether we will perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the confeſsing of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Many men do ſwarue and go backe in the time of temptation, as ſone as any grieuouſe affliction doth ariſe. But the godly at no time do better proue and trie their weakenes and wittes, than in the time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and affliction.</p>
                        <p>Alſo we are tempted, that the ſinceritie of our mindes may be made manifeſt to other men. So did god tempte Abraham,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> when he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to offer his ſonne Iſaac for a ſacrifice.</p>
                        <p>God ſayde to Moyſes: Beholde, I will cauſe bread to raine from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for you, and the people ſhall go out,<note place="margin">Exod. 16</note> and gather that that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for euerie daye, that I maye proue them whether they will walke in my lawes or no.</p>

                        <p>Againe, in Deuteronomie: if there ariſe among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreames, (and geue thee a ſigne or wonder, and the ſigne or the wonder whiche he hath tolde thee, come to paſse) ſaying: let vs goe after other gods which thou haſt not knowne, and let vs ſerue them: thou ſhalt not hearken vnto the words of that prophet, or vnto that dreamer of dreames: for the Lord your God proueth you, to knowe whether you loue the Lord your god, with al your hart, and with all your ſoule.</p>

                        <p>The ſecond kind of temptation is, the temptation of the fleſh, and the malice and euill affection which by nature is graffed in vs. The ſenſes and thoughtes of mans hart, are prone and readie to ill from their youth.</p>

                        <p>This temptation and luſte of the fleſh, which Sathan by meruailouſe ſuggeſtions doth ſet on fire, tempteth vs to infidelitie, to blaſpheme the name of god, to contempne the goſpel, and to hate our neighboures, and to all maner of wickedneſse &amp; ſinne. Of this temptation ſpeaketh ſainct Iames, ſaying: God is not a tempter of the wicked, for he tempteth no man They are tempted which be lead awaye and intiſed by luſt and concupiſcence, that is: God is not the author of ill, he tempteth not to wickedneſse, that ye may laye the faulte on him.

                     <p>On the other ſide, they which do not flie, do ſo iudge of them that do flie, yea and do geue out ſuch ill report of them, that they do ſcarſe counte them worthie to be called Chriſtians.</p>

For what pretence ſoeuer they make, it is moſt certaine, that they neither iudge well of them ſelues, neither yet of god, which doth ſmite and plague men.</p>
                     <p>They thinke, that this rodde of peſtilence is like to <gap reason="foreign">

But we knowe, that is moſt certainly affirmed of Chriſt, that all the heares of our head are no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred to our heauenly father.</p>
                     <p>They ſaye, that they which do abide ſtill, do ſo tempt God, as they do, which when the houſe is on fire, and like to be burned, yet do remaine ſtill in the houſe, and put them ſelues in daunger of death.</p>
                     <p>But theſe men do not obſerue and marke, that manye which do not flie, yet are not taken nor infected with the peſtilence. And on the other ſide, that many alſo which do flie, yet they do not eſcape, but are infected.<note place="margin">Exod. 9. Leuiticus. 26 Deuter. 28. 1. Paral. 21. Ezechiel. 6 14. et. 33.</note> Vvhereupon it euidently appeareth that the plague of peſtilence is infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the moderation of God. And that the peſtilence is the plague &amp; ſcourge of god, it may be proued in many places of the ſcriptures.</p>
                     <p>Vvhat Chriſtian will ſo thincke or iudge of God, that he doth eyther raſhly or without ſcience or nombre ſo ſmit, that whoſoeuer dieth of the peſtilence, doth therfore die, becauſe he fled not from the place infected. And that man by chaungyng of places might eſcape the handes of God. But the ſcriptures do other wiſe inſtruct vs.</p>
                     <p>In Ezechiel they be marcked and ſigned, whome god ſpared and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured. Againe in an other place it is graunted vnto Noe, Iob, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, that if they wer preſent when the peſtilence rageth, for their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes they ſhuld ſaue theyr own liues or ſoules. Therfore, they which flie the peſtilence, do ſeme to me to do as vnhapie children do, who when their father is angrie, hauing a rod in his hand minding to beate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do flie out of the houſe, and by that meanes do the more exaſperate the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers moode and angre. And yet notwithſtanding they not eſcape the rod by this their fliyng away, but do by it purchace to them ſelues more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſharper ſtripes.</p>
                     <p>But they ſeme rather to flye well, which with humble ſubmiſsion of
<pb facs="tcp:7195:377"/> mind, with the acknowledging of their ſinnes, and by true repentaunce do pacifie and mittigat the wrath of God ſo ſmiting them.</p>
                     <p>Ouer and beſide, they offende againſt chriſtian charitie, which do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh and forſake their brothers and neighbours in ſuch troubles and afflictions. The chriſtians in times paſte were wonte to imparte their helpe and pitie, euen vnto the heathen and gentiles, in ſuch plages and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes. They therfore whiche do labour with ſuch infirmitie of fayth and charitie, what maruell is it that they do flie from the horrour of death?</p>
                     <p>Nowe as touchinge them whiche do not flie, let them firſt conſider wherfore, and for what cauſe they do not flye, whither it be for lacke of certain neceſsarie charges whereby they may the better flie, or for any other cauſe. It is one thing, not to flie eyther by temeritie, or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte of the wrath of God, or for wante of monie or coſtage (for ſo the Turcks and infideles do.) And it is another thing, for one being armed with faith and charitie, to humble himſelfe in the ſight of god, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to appeaſe his wrath, and ſo to tarrie with his brethren and neighbours, miſerablie a afflicted, and to mourn with them that mourne.</p>
                     <p>Alſo let them take hede that they iudge not ill of them which do flie, nor raile on them, nor curſe them, but by the affection of brotherly loue, be ſorie for their infirmitie, and committe their flight vnto gods cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie: for excepte they do ſo, they may be counted a great deale worſe than they which do flie. <hi>Haec Muſculus in Pſalm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But by maiſter Muſculus leaue and pacience I do iudge that god doth allow euerie man to vſe ſuche remedies as phiſicke doth appointe. For the wiſe man ſaith in his booke Eccleſiaſticus. Honour the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that honour that is due vnto him, becauſe of neceſsitie, for the Lord hath created him, for of the moſt high commeth healing. And a litle after he ſaith: The Lorde hath created medicines of the earth, and he that is wiſe, will not abhorre it.</p>
                     <p>Nowe the phiſition ſaith that the beſt remedie to auoide the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, is to flie the aire. For to ſpeake naturallie, all peſtilence, as Galene writeth, commeth of the putrefaction and corruption of the aire. And the inſpiration of that aire is the cauſe why beaſtes and menne are ſo infected and taken with the peſtilence: whiche aire we canne not auoide, vnles wee flie to ſome other place where the aire is not ſo infected. Yet here is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that they which haue office, and can not well by reaſon of their office flie, as paſtours, preachers, and certaine magiſtrats, either politique or oeconomicall, ought to tarie ſtill in their vſuall abode, and to prouide other remedies preſcribed by phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke to conſerue them in health.</p>

                     <p>This kinde of faſt was vſed in the time of the Apoſtles, as is read in the Actes. And this faſt to the old fathers ſemeth nothing or very little to haue differed from publicke mourning, wherof ther are many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the ſcriptures.</p>
                     <p>Priuate neceſsity is, when any man doth faſt, feeling him ſelfe to be vexed of his own luſt or concupiſcence, from which he taketh away the cauſe, that it may the leſſe inflame and burne.</p>

                     <p>Alſo in his epistle <hi>ad Bonifacium,</hi> he reherceth three kinds of death, wherewith the Donatiſtes willingly deſired to be killed, or rather kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them ſelues.

Other of them thought it a ſport to throwe them ſelues downe hedlonge from high places into the water and into the fire. Theſe three kindes of death (ſaith Auſtine) the deuell taught them, who ſuggeſted Chriſt to caſt himſelf downe hedlong from the pinacle of the temple.</p>
                     <p>So in like maner in theſe daies the Anabaptiſts with certain other, deſire to haue croſses layde vpon them without iuſt cauſe, or before God doth lay them vpon their ſhoulders. Vvhere they both tempte God, &amp; breake the commaundement of Chriſt, who ſaith to his diſciples: If they perſecute you in one citie, flie to an other. For Chriſte would not haue vs to caſte our ſelues raſhely and without vrgent cauſe into the handes of the raging enemies, or to the perill of death. Nor a chriſtian ought to be imbraided or rebuked for flying of perſecution, ſo that he flie as he ought to do: and alſo when he ought to do, as Helias by flying did eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the furie of Ieſabel.

                        <p>If the paſtour of a church be ſo neceſſarie to the christian publique weale, and for his ſhepe to be fedde that his preſence muſt needes be had, than he ought not to flie, but ought with daunger of life to gouerne, kepe and deliuer his ſhepe committed to his charge, from the perill of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all death.

                        <p>On the other parte.

                        <p>In the thirde ſignification of the name of a wolfe, a diſtinction is to be made. For the perſecution is eyther perſonall, or els generall.

<pb facs="tcp:7195:387"/> they ſought them vnto death, what will they do I praye you, when they ſee Iacob flying from his brother Eſau? and Moſes for feare of Pharao to departe to the Madianites?

                        <p>Again, what will theſe praters ſaye, when they ſee that great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Elias called a God, and raiſing the dead, to hide him ſelfe for feare of Achab, and to flye the menaces of Ieſabell: At what tyme alſo the children of the prophetes being ſoughte vnto death, did kepe them ſelues cloſe in dennes with Abdias.

But what do they not know that the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for feare of the Iewes did ſeeke ſecrete and cloſe places? Do they not know, that Paule was let ouer the wall in a baſket at Damaſcus, when the Gentiles ſought him to deliuer hym to the Rular?</p>
                        <p>And a litle after he ſayth, in the conſummation of the worlde when that worde of the father came whiche ſpake to Moſes, before he made and gaue againe a commaundement of flying, ſaying: when they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you in one citie, flye to an other.</p>
                        <p>He ſaith alſo, when ye ſhall ſe the abhomination, of deſolation which was ſpoken of before in Daniel ſtanding in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy place, he that redeth let him vnderſtande. Then let them which be in Iewrie, flee vnto the hilles, and he that is in the houſe toppe, let him not come downe to take any thyng out of his houſe, and he which is in the feildes, let him not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home to fetch his garments.</p>
                        <p>Vvhen the holye men of God knewe this, they framed their lyfe to this rule, for that which God hath inioyned, is to be done. And ther fore the worde it ſelfe whiche was made man for vs, would (when he was ſought to be perſecuted) flye and auoyde the aſſaultes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutour. For it becomed him to ſhewe hym ſelfe to beare our fleſhe, and to be made man, not onely in hungryng, thyrſtyng, and ſuffring, but alſo in the reaſon and meanes of flying. For aſſone as he was borne, and alſo when he was a childe, Ioſeph was commaunded of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to take the child, and his mother to flye awaye, for Herode ſought his life. And after, when Herod was dead, fearing Archelaus, departed into Nazareth.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore when by healyng the withered hande, he ſhewed hym ſelfe to be God, and the Iewes ſeekyng counſell to kill him, he beynge not ignoraunt of their aſsaults, departed from theſe places.</p>
                        <p>Alſo after he had raiſed Lazarus from death, from that houre
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7195:387"/> they tooke counſell to kill him. Vvherfore Ieſus did not walke openlye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, but went into a place nere to the wildernes.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore when he ſaid: <hi>Antequam Abraham fieret, ego ſum.</hi> Before Abraham was, I am. The Iewes takyng vp ſtones to caſte at him, he hidde him ſelfe, and wente out of the temple, paſsing through the middeſt of them.</p>
                        <p>Ieſus alſo hearing the martyrdome of Iohn the Baptiſt, whom when his diſciples had buried, he went into a ſhippe and departed into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerte. Therfore as the Lorde did, ſo he taught. Now <hi>I</hi> feare leaſt theſe men not ſtayinge their luſt and pleaſure of imbraidyng within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of mans checkes, but being caried further with their madnes, will obiecte alſo vnto their Lorde God timiditie and fearfulnes. But who can abide and ſuffer them ſo raging and running into ſuch madnes?

                     <p>Dreido in his diſſolution of the fift difficulty, writeth, that the boke of wiſdome is intituled of the auncient Fathers, the booke of Salomon, not that it was written of Salomon the carnal ſonne of Dauid, but that it containeth the ſentences of Chriſt the true Salomon, vttred of hym which was Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelf figuring Chriſt, or els bering his perſon. For it is vſed often in the ſcriptures, that that which ſpeaketh, doth ſpeake in the perſon of an other. So many ſentences of this booke,<note place="margin">Cap. 7.8.9.</note> which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour ſpeaketh of him ſelfe litterally vnderſtand, agreeth onely to Salo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon, who being made king, wiſhed aboue all goods in the world, that he might obtaine wiſdome, with the which there came vnto him all other goods: vnto whom God alſo ſaid, that he ſhould build him a temple in his holy hill. Vvherupon Salomon knew in ſpirit that Chriſt was the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God the father. Therfore, although this booke is now (as ſaint Hierome ſaith) any wher found in the Hebrue toung, but doth rather ſauour of the Greeke eloquence: yet it doth not follow that Salomon did not make or geue forth the ſentences and doctrines of this booke. For as much as Salomon (as the ſcripture teſtifieth) wrate. <hi>3000</hi> parables, and <hi>5000.</hi> verſes, and intreated of beastes, foules, creeping things, &amp; fiſhes, and diſputed of herbes and trees, euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the yſope vnto the Cedar tree.

                     <p>The prouerbs of Salomon, made of Salomon, were not written &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched of him into one booke, but thoſe things which wer diſperſed abrod, were afterward brought into one booke in the time of Ezechias, &amp; wer gathered together of the Ministers of Ezechias,<note place="margin">Cap. 25.</note> king of Iuda, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the booke of Prouerbs.

                     <p>Fourthly, it is taken in the good ſenſe,<note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> and is contrary vnto obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and hardnes of the hart, as it is vſed in Ezechiel: <hi>Auferam cor lapi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um de carne eorum, et dabo eis cor carneum.</hi> I wil take away the ſtonye hart out of their bodies, &amp; wil geue them an hart of fleſh, that is, a ſoft, gentle, and mollified hart, ready to receiue the word of God.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, it is taken in the ill ſenſe, and ſo it is taken moſt often, &amp; then it ſignifieth euery thing that lacketh the ſpirite of God, as in Geneſis. <hi>Ed dixit Iehoua: non iudicabit ſpiritus meus in homine, quia caro eſt.</hi> My ſpirite ſhal not alwaies ſtriue with man, becauſe he is but fleſh.</p>
                     <p>And likewiſe in the Epistle to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15</note> 
                        <hi>ſapientia carnis mors eſt,</hi> and in infinite other places of the ſcriptures.</p>

                        <p>Phocius (as the Greke ſcholies do reporte) was of the ſame ſentence, who ſaith that faith ſhal endure in heauen. For then we ſhal be moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the contemplacion of God. He affirmeth the ſame alſo of hope, becauſe ther is (ſaith he) a ſure poſſeſsion: for that which we hoped for, will be preſent vnto vs, and they which hoped, ſhal not be defrauded of the things hoped for.</p>
                        <p>And among the ſcholemen Durandus was of this cenſure.</p>
                        <p>But their aſſertions are againſt the ſayings of Paule, which attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute imperfection to faith, that is, to the notice and knowledge of God, which we haue in this world, becauſe it is had by a glaſſe in a darke ſpeeche, neither it is in the whole, but in part. And <hi>per antitheſin,</hi> he ſaith, that we ſhall know in our country, as we be knowne, and ſee face to face.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the definition of faith is againſt them. For in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebrues, faith is ſaid to be an euidence of thinges which are not ſene, but then althings ſhall appeare and be made open. Therfore faith than and there can haue no place.</p>
                        <p>And in the epiſtle to the Romaines we reade, that the hope which is ſene, is not hope, for els how doth a man hope for that he ſeeth?</p>
                        <p>But let vs ſee what Paule wil haue to be vnderſtand by theſe words

                           <hi>Maxima ex hiis charitas,</hi> the greateſt of theſe is charity.</p>
                        <p>Euery mans faith and hope profiteth himſelfe, charitye is extended to other.</p>
                        <p>Faith and hope are in the time of imperfection, Charity ſhall abide in the ſtate of perfection, that is, it ſhalbe perpetuall, when faith and hope ſhal haue their end.</p>
                        <p>If we diſcuſſe and ſearche out al the effectes of faith, faith ſhalbe the worthier and ſuperiour to charity: for charity is the effect of faith. The effect without doubt is inferiour to the cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Saint Iohn ſaith, that faith is the victory which ouercommeth the world: which cannot be ſaid of charity.</p>
                        <p>By faith we are borne againe, and made the ſonnes of God, and do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the eternal faith, and by faith Chriſt dwelleth in vs. And ſo faith in many things is ſuperiour to charity. And chariti is called the greateſt, not in all reſpectes, but in that it ſhalbe perpetual, and becauſe nowe it is the greateſt meane and way to preſerue the church.</p>
                        <p>I maruel here that the Papiſts doo ſtand in thei owne conceites, in miſtaking theſe words of Paule. If faith (ſay they) doth iustify: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much more charity doth iuſtify, becauſe charity is called greater.</p>
                        <p>See I pray you what an argument this is: Charity is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith. Ergo charity doth iuſtify.</p>
                        <p>The like argument is this: The king is more noble and greater than a plough man and a ſhoomaker. Therfore the king can plow the ground or ſoe a ſhoo better, then either of them.</p>
                        <p>Again, a man is more noble &amp; better then an horſe. Therfore he wil runne ſwifter then an horſe, and wil cary a greater burden.</p>
                        <p>The angels are more excellent than the Sunne and Moone. Therfore they wyl geue more light to the earth.</p>
                        <p>If the power and ſtrength of iuſtifieng did depend of the woorthines and merite of faith, it were another matter.</p>
                        <p>But faith iuſtifieth not, becauſe it is more worthy, but bicauſe it doth apprend righteouſnes, frely offred and geuen in the Goſpel.</p>

                     <p>God in the old teſtament did institute many and diuers feastes, that he might admoniſh the people of the benefites done vnto them, that he might inſtruct the ignoraunt, and that he might keepe them all in the true woorſhipping of God. But all their feaſtes were not ſolemniſed a like. They did ſacrifice dayly at morning and Euening. The ſeuenth day of euery weeke was kept holy. Euery moneth had a proper feaſt: Alſo eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yeare ther were thre ſolempne holy daies obſerued and kept.

                     <p>Alſo the ſeuenth day of the weeke, the memoriall of the creation of the world, was celebrate by offring ſacrifices, and by thankes geuing.

                     <p>Scenopegia was celebrate in remembraunce of the habitation of the people of Iſrael in the deſert, fourty yeares in tabernacles, that by thys ceremony, they might call to remembraunce all the benefite of their deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueraunce.

                     <p>Pentecoſte was ordeined in remembraunce of the confirmation of the Goſpel, by the viſible ſending of the holye ghoſt, and by the miraculous giftes of the tounges.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, it is profitable to know the histories of the church, for out of them we may take doctrine, confirmation, and conſolation.</p>

                     <p>Fiftly, that ſaintes may be vnto vs examples of repentance and godly life, of true worſhipping, of confeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our faith, of conſtancy, of pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; of other vertues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may frame our liues after their godly exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, that with godly affection we may deſire the company and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the ſaintes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe &amp; other mo are weighty cauſes why we do retaine and keepe ſome feastes of ſaints in the church. Vvould God that many did not abuſe the feaſtes of Saintes and Martirs vnto voluptuouſnes and madnes, as the papiſtes do in nightly daunecs, in garlands of loue, in ſwilling and bol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling and other vices not pleaſing God, his angels, and ſaintes, but they do ſerue Sathan, to the contempt of God, his Aungels and Saintes.

<pb facs="tcp:7195:397"/> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is nothing els then to attribut true vertu vnto him. As when a king or prince doth rule iuſtly, wiſely, puiſauntly and mercifully, his ſubiectes do attribut glory vnto him, that is, they do allow his doings, and with a ſingular beneuolence do reporte wel of him. Likewiſe glorie is geuen to God when his vertues, wiſdome, righteouſnes, power, mercie, &amp;c are truly knowledged and vnderſtanded.</p>
                     <p>The wiſdom of god is knowen in this, that he doth repair man which he had made to his owne glorie, that he might recouer againe the image which he had loſt through ſinne, by the merits of his derelye beloued ſon Ieſus Chriſt, and to geue the glory of wiſdome vnto god.</p>
                     <p>The righteouſnes of God is knowen by this, that he would not receyue mankinde againe into his fauour, without recompence of the wrong don. For, when it was nedeful, either that man ſhould periſh and die for euer through ſin, or els, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſom, which came of the ſeed of man, ſhould appeaſe almighty god by ſuffring puniſhment for all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind: God gaue his onely begotten ſonne, which tooke vpon him the nature of man, in the which he ſatisfied the iuſtice of god. Vvherfore, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſe &amp; glorie of righteouſnes is worthely to be attributed vnto god our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The puiſſaunce and power of god is knowne in this, that he ouercame the ſerpent and his ſeed by Chriſt, and vtterly aboliſhed the kingdome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel, as touching al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue apprehended Ieſus Chriſt by faith. And therfore the glorie and power of ſtrength is to be geuen to God.</p>
                     <p>The mercie of god appeareth in this, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind being deſtroyed &amp; oppreſſed with the tirannie of the deuel, and with gret aduerſities &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lamities, as with death, hel, and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is taken again into the fauor of God by his ſon, and for his ſonne. This mercie of god excelleth all other worckes of god, which mercy the holy Angels and electe people of God do and ſhal ſet forth, yea the deuels alſo, wil they, nill they, ſhal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. And ſo the glorie of mercy is to be geuen to God.</p>
                     <p>The veritie of god is opened and declared in this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god being mindfull of his former couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, doth performe that which he promiſed.

               <p>Peter doth here improue ſuche, and ſayth that they ought to be ſober, and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their fayth to be a liuely fayth, and doth commend ſuch a fayth which ſheweth her ſelfe forth by good workes and godly conuerſation.</p>
               <p>Note here, that as great watchinges doth conſume the groſſe humours of the body, and doth make a groſſe man ſlenderer and leaner: So a chriſtian watch, that is, a liuely fayth, doth ſeeth away &amp; conſume vnchaſte affections. It taketh away the ſurfet of mans wiſedome, it taketh away feare, inconſtancie and impacience, it contemneth the ioyes and pleaſures of the worlde, and doth wholye bequeath it ſelfe vnto God.</p>
               <p>Although Peter would haue vs to be ſober eyther in minde or in bodye: yet he meaneth not, nor commaundeth that a man ſhould deſtroy his bodye, or make it more weake then it ought to be, either with faſtings or watchings, wherwith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue made them ſelues vnprofitable members, both to a common wealth, and to the eccleſiaſticall miniſterye.</p>

For he did afflicte his bodye with great abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that he got him ſuch a lothſome ſauour by it, that he could not liue together in the companye of other men. But at length he was deliuered from this errour, and commaunded his brethren, that they ſhould not ouermuch weare awaye and conſume theyr bodye by ſuch ſtraight kynde of lyfe. It followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perfecte ſperate in eam graciam quae vobis offertur,</hi> that is: Truſt perfectly on the grace that is brought vnto you. Such is a true chriſtian fayth, that it wholy and vtterly with a moſt perfecte truſt doth leane vnto the worde of God, &amp; attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to do boldly thoſe things, what ſoeuer ought or behoueth to be done. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Peter ſayth: Then are the loynes of your minde girded vp, then is your fayth whole and ſound, when committing your ſelues ſurely and ſafely vnto the worde of God, you dare do al things, not weighing nor regarding what thing ſoeuer of yours is brought into perill &amp; daunger: Whether it be your goods, your worldly name, yea or your whole life. In thoſe wordes S. Peter doth deſcribe very aptlie a ſincere and not a fayned fayth: For that fayth which is not liuely, is to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rather a dreame, than a fayth. But a liuely and perfecte fayth, doth cauſe man to depend wholye on the worde, and not to paſſe or care what fortune ſoeuer God doth caſte on his ſhoulders, yea and to runne through thicke and thinne, and to ſuſteine both ſharpe and ſower for the Lordes ſake and his worde. As when death is offred, it behoueth a faythfull man to committe himſelfe boldlye vnto Chriſt, to offer hys necke vnto the axe, hys body to the fire and boldly to reſiſte the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries power. Such a fayth and truſt doth S. Peter here require of all chriſtians, which faith doth not ſtand in cogitation and words onely, but in vertue &amp; power.</p>
               <p>Now (ſayth Peter after) truſte on the grace that is brought vnto you. That is to ſay: You haue not deſerued thys great grace, but it is freely offred vnto you. For the Goſpell which doth ſhewe and ſet forth this grace vnto vs, was not exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate and inuented of vs, but the holy ghoſt ſent it from heauen vnto vs.</p>
               <p>But what I pray you is offred vnto vs? Forſoth euen this: that he which bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in Chriſt, and doth ſtedfaſtly cleaue vnto his worde, now hath and poſſeſſeth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7195:398"/> all the goods of the Lord, with the Lord. So that he is made Lorde and maiſter of ſinne, death, deuill, and hell, and is aſſured of eternall life.</p>
               <p>This ſo great treaſure is offred vnto vs euen at our doores. It is put into our boſome without all our endeuour, merite, or deſerte. It commeth (I ſay) vnlooked for, we thinking of no ſuch thing. Therfore thapoſtle Peter exhorteth vs, that we boldly and ſurely looke for this truſt and grace, becauſe God which doth offer it, cannot lie.</p>
               <p>This word offred or brought, hath a merueilous energie and great liberalitie in it, as though Peter ſhould ſay, you nede not to take great labours and paynes, you nede not to runne on pilgrimage, you nede not to go from countrey to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to ſeeke this grace. It offreth it ſelfe vnto you, although you be at home, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you be in the field, or where ſoeuer you ſhal be. This onely remaineth that you do receaue it, when it is offred. Theſe be the true riches of God, that franckly, frelie, and willinglye he geueth his mercye and grace to them which ſeeke it not:<note place="margin">Eſay. 52.</note> (As it is written in Eſay:) <hi>Palam factus ſum non quaerentibus me.</hi> I was made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and knowen to them which ſought me not.</p>

How great therfore is our ingratitude. if we do neglecte and contemne this grace ſo gentlie, and louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſhewed and offred vnto vs? Which if we do contemn, the great wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God is to be looked for. Saint Paule in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes ſaith. <hi>Quomodo effugiemus, ſi tantam neglexirimus ſalutem?</hi> How ſhal we eſcape, if we neglecte ſo great a ſaluation? It followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In reuelatione Ieſu Chriſti:</hi> by the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt. That is, God the father offreth his grace vnto none, but by Chriſt. Wherefore let no mortall man preſume to come into the preſence &amp; ſight of God, without this Mediatour Chriſt. He will here none except he bring as an aduocate his deare beloued ſonne Chriſt, whom onely he doth reſpecte and regarde,<note place="margin">6. Baptiſme.</note> and for whoſe ſake all perſons and all things do pleaſe God the father, as his voyce declared in the time of the Baptiſme of Chriſt, which ſounded and ſaid: <hi>Hic eſt filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placui.</hi> This is my beloued ſonne, in whom I am well pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Chriſt came for this end, that taking our fleſhe and bloud, he might ioyne hym ſelfe with vs to obteine grace with the father for vs. By this fayth in Chriſt all the Prophets and Patriarches were ſaued. For it behoued al men to beleue that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe which was made to Abraham: <hi>In ſemine tuo benedicentur omnes gentes,</hi> In thy ſeede ſhall all nations be bleſſed. Therefore the faith of the Iewes, and of the Turkes, and of them that truſt in theyr own workes, and hope by them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne, heauen is a vayne faith, or rather no fayth. For euery religion which hath not Chriſt for a captaine and guide, is prophane, wicked, and naughtie. But if it haue Chriſt, it is perfect, and abſolute.</p>
               <p>I remember two olde verſes tending much to this matter, which be very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy to be noted.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Hoc eſt ne ſcire, ſine Chriſto plurima ſcire,</l>
                  <l>Chriſtum ſi bene ſcis, ſatis eſt, ſi caetera neſcis.</l>
                  <l>To know much without Chriſt, is nothing expedient,</l>
                  <l>But well to know Chriſt, is onely ſufficient.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>In reuelatione Ieſu Chriſti:</hi> That is, by the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt. By the Goſpel declared vnto vs, what chriſt is, that is to ſay, that he is our Sauiour, that it is he which taketh awaye our ſinnes, that it is he which deliuereth vs from all euills, that it is he which doth reconcile vs to the father, and maketh vs iuſte and
<pb facs="tcp:7195:399"/> righteous without our owne worckes. He whiche knoweth not Chriſt after this maner, is much deceyued, and cleane out of the waye. For although thou knowe Chriſt to be the ſonne of God,<note place="margin">7. Rihgt ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> to haue died, to haue riſen again, and now to ſyt on the right hande of the father: thou doeſt not yet know Chriſt, nor this knowledge ſhall any thing proffitte thee. But it is neceſſary that thou know and beleue him to haue done all theſe thinges for thee, to helpe, ſuccour, and comfort thee.</p>
               <p>Chriſte ought not ſo to be preached, that he liueth and reigneth onely to hym ſelfe, but that he is ours. For otherwiſe what ſhould it haue proffited hym to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende into the earth, and to haue ſhed his bloud? Therfore he was ſente into the world, not for his owne cauſe, but that the world might be ſaued by hym, and that he might become whollie ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In reuelatione Ieſu Chriſti:</hi> by the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt. That is, with a moſt ſted faſte hope apprehende and receyue you this grace offred. For Chriſt is not ſhewed vnto vs obſcurely and darckly, as he was ſhewed in olde tyme to the prophetes,<note place="margin">8. Goliah.</note> and by the Prophetes. For they do ſet forth Chriſt to be a ſauiour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, as it were in miſteries. For they ſignified hym ſomtimes by Iſaac to be ſlayne of his father. Somtime by Dauid who ſlewe great Goliath: ſomtime by Salomon and his peaſable kyngdome, with ſuch and other like places was Chriſt vnderſtanded of the faithful in time paſt. But vnto vs, he is openly and plainlye declared without al figures, types, and miſteries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Summa ſummarum.</hi> This is the minde of Peter: You neede not to take any great iourney to come vnto the grace of God. For God hath preuented your iour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney in bringing and offringe this grace vnto you. But becauſe the fruition ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not yet hadde, vntill Chriſte appeare from heauen (in whome is hidden the ſaluation of the godly) in the meane time we muſt hope, and that perfectly hope, for otherwiſe this grace of Chriſte is offred to vs in vaine, vnles we ſuſteine and abide paciently, vntil the comming of Chriſt. It followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaſi filii obedientiae.</hi> As obedient children: It is ordeyned by nature, that the children repreſent and followe their fathers. You are made (ſaith Peter) the children of Chriſte by a liuelye faith, whiche was made obedient vnto his father euen vnto death, folow you therfore your father. And foraſmuch as it is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted be nature, that we ſhould obeye our parentes, it is neceſſary that we become obedient children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To obeye,</hi> doth ſignifie in the ſcriptures to beleue. And he is an obedient ſon which doth heare the goſpel and word of God, and by fayth embraceth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In Titum.</note>Therfore if it be not the worde of God, heare it not, but rather ſpurne at it with thy feete, and regarde it not. For (as ſaint Hierome ſaith) <hi>Sine authoritate ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turas, garrulitas non habet fidem:</hi> without the authoritie of ſcriptures, all pratyng and talkyng ought to haue no credite.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quaſi filii obedientiae,</hi> as obedient children. Peter doth firſt ſignifie that we are called of the Lord by the goſpel into the right title and honour of adoption. Secondly he ſheweth that we be adopted on this condition, that God might haue vs as children obedient vnto him. For although obedience doth not make vs children (for that is the free gifte of God) yet obedience doth diſcerne and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhe vs from ſtraungers. And howe farre this obedience doth extende and ſtretche it ſelfe, Peter doth teach, when he forbiddeth the children of God to faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and frame them ſelues to the deſires of this world, but doth exhort that they ſhuld conforme them ſelues rather vnto God. The ſumme and ſcope of the whole law &amp; of all things whiche god doth require of vs, doth pertayne to this ende: that the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7195:399"/> image of God maye ſhine in vs, leaſte we become children whiche do degenerat from the father. But becauſe all the ſenſes and whole diſpoſition of our fleſh, are repugnaunt vnto God, and the whole nature and condition of our mynd, is enemie vnto him, therfore Peter beginneth our obedience from the renouncyng and forſakyng of the worlde and the luſtes therof, &amp; that we do put of the image of olde Adam with his luſtes. Therfore Peter ſayth as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non configurati prioribus ignorantiae veſtrae deſideriis:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">10. Ignorance.</note> Not faſhionynge your ſelues vnto the former luſtes of your ignoraunce. Peter here doth exhorte vs vnto puritie of life, by an agrument taken of hurte, and perill like to enſue. Doe ye not faſhion your ſelues (ſaith he) to your olde concupiſcences and luſtes, and to the corrupt maners of the olde man, by the which death and perpetuall priſonment hangeth ouer you. You haue put on a newe lyfe, and none other then heauenlye, before the whiche obteyned, you gaue your ſelues to gluttonie,<note place="margin">11.

You knew not Chriſt, therfore light and true knowledge was far from you. You were ignoraunt of thoſe thynges which were geuen and ſhalbe geuen hereafter through Chriſt. You lyued before as blinde,<note place="margin">Prouerb. 14.</note> not knowynge which waye to holde or kepe. It is the propretie of ſinne to deceyue fooles.

And faſhion not your ſelues lyke vnto this worlde, but be you chaunged by the renuing of your minde, that ye maye proue what is the good will of God, and acceptable and perfecte.</p>

                  <hi>Non configurati &amp;c.</hi> Not faſhionyng your ſelues vnto the former luſtes of your ignoraunce.

For where the fayth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt is abſente, there can be none other thyng, but errour and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that it can not be knowen what is right, what is wronge, what is true, what is falſe, what is good, what is badde, ſo that men through ignoraunce do fall hedlonge into diuerſe kyndes of vices. After what maner it was with vs of late dayes in the time of ſuperſtition, when Chriſt and his glory was darckened, and his word aboliſhed. For then had we errour for truth, ignoraunce for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, blindenes for lyght.

                  <p>Such a feare god doth require of vs, that we may abhorre and deteſte ſinne, and that wee maye diligentlye benefitte and do good to our neyghboures, while we liue in this worlde.</p>
                  <p>A chriſtian whiche hath a right faith, hath all the good benefittes of God, and is the ſonne of God, but his tyme in this worlde is nothing els but a pilgrimage. For his ſpirite is alredie in heauen by fayth, by the which ſpirite he is gouernour of all thynges. But god ſuffreth hym to liue yet in the fleſhe, and to haue bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilye conuerſation in the worlde, that he maye helpe other, and that he may bring them with him to be heauen.</p>
                  <p>Therfore we muſt behaue our ſelues in this worlde, none otherwiſe then they do which iourneying into farre countries, do take their inne and eaſe, for they are ſatiſfied if they haue meate and lodgyng for one night of the hoſte, neither do they clayme or chalendge to them ſelues his ſubſtaunce or goodes.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe euery man muſt vſe worldly goods as though they wer not his own, and muſt take ſo muche of them, as is ſufficient for the ſuſtentation of oure bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, helping our neighbours with the ouerplus.</p>
                  <p>Therfore the life of man is as it were but a reſtyng place, we muſt take our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney thither where our father is, that is, into heauen. Wherfore we muſt laye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye all ſlouthfull, wanton and careles liuyng, and paſſe the time of our dwelling here (as ſainct Peter ſayth) in the feare of god. It followeth.</p>

                     <hi>Scientes quòd non corruptibilibus auro, &amp;c.</hi> Knowing that ye were not rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with corruptible thinges, as ſiluer and gold, from your vaine conuerſation receyued by the traditions of the fathers. Peter doth perſeuer to exhorte vs to holy lyfe and chriſtian religion, takynge his argument of the ineſtimable price of oure redemption, as if he ſhoulde ſaye: Continue you in faith, and in louing one an other, conſideringe that you are redemed with ſuche a price, as farre paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth mans reaſon. You that firſte were inhabitantes and citizens of this world, vnder the thraldome and yoke of Sathan, are nowe made the citizens of heauen,<note place="margin">19.

He calleth their fathers traditions vaine and fonde, becauſe they whiche were gentiles, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructe and brought vp in Idolatrie, and they which were Iewes, had learned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſuperſtitions. By the which they did violate and breake many waies the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God, wherfore Chriſt reproued them in Mathew ſaying: <hi>Quare &amp; vos tranſgredimini mandatum dei propter traditionem veſtram?</hi> Why do you alſo breake the commaundement of God by your traditions?</p>
                  <p>Sainct Paule ſaith, that he perſecuted the church of God, when not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng he thought him ſelfe to be a great follower of the traditions of the fathers. All traditions are vain and fooliſh whatſoeuer they be, which do repugne the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt. For where Chriſt wanteth, ther is mere vanitie.</p>
                  <p>Or els ſaincte Peter by the vayne traditions of the fathers, doth meane conuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſation of life, according to Moiſes law, which was vaine and weake to the attey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of eternall life. The worckes of the lawe did not iuſtifie of them ſelues, they were but ſhadowes and figures, and could not remitte ſinne. From theſe lawiſhe
<pb facs="tcp:7195:401"/> worckes the Iewes were deliuered, beinge no more bounde to Moſes lawe, which Chriſt our ſauyour hath ſo fulfilled, that it nede not anye more to be ſought. For what can it demaunde or aſke of vs, when we are nothinge bounde to it, but it is in al poyntes fulfilled by Chriſt? It followeth.</p>

Before this, ſaithe Peter, ye were citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the worlde, liuinge vnder the imperie and rule of the deuel: but god nowe hath deliuered you from that wicked conuerſation, and hath brought you into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, that nowe ye mighte be citizens in heauen, and ſtraungers in earth. But conſider you howe muche god hathe beſtowed for you, and how great a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it is, by the which ye are redemed and brought to this point, that ye are becom the ſonnes of god. But what is that great and precious treaſure wherwith ye are redemed? Not corruptible thinges as golde and ſiluer, but the precious bloude of the ſonne of god. This treaſure is ſo noble and excellente, and of ſo imcomparable a price, that no ſenſe or reaſon is able to comprehende and conceyue it.</p>
                  <p>Yea, it is ſo precious, that one droppe of this innocent bloud had bene ſufficient for the ſinnes of the whole worlde. But it pleaſed the eternall father to poure his grace ſo largelie vpon vs,<note place="margin">21. All his bloude.</note> and with ſo great a price to purchace our ſaluation, that he would his ſonne Ieſus Chriſte to ſhed all his bloud, and to geue alſo that whole treaſure vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Peter therfore requireth that we ſhake not of this ſo great a grace, and to wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe it lightlie and ſlenderlie, but rather ſo to eſteme it, that we maie be moued and egged forwarde to feare. In the which feare we liuinge, maye not againe deſerue to be depriued of this noble treaſure. It followeth.</p>

In the whiche wordes Peter doth throughly ouerthrowe that thinge which we are wonte to leane vnto, thincking that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we do, ought to be allowed, for that they were done of olde tyme, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our elders and fathers (amonge whome there were many, both wiſe and good) did obſerue and kepe the like thinges.</p>
                  <p>But Peter here doth ſay, whatſoeuer thinges your fathers dyd, eyther ordayne or vſed to do, were al ill: yea inſomuch that thoſe things which you learned of them,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7195:401"/> concerning the worſhipping of God, were ſo ill, that it behoued, notwithſtanding the ſonne of God to beſtowe his bloud, that men might be deliuered from the ſame wickednes. Whatſoeuer therfore is not waſhed and clenſed by thys bloud, it is all infecte, corrupte and curſed. Whereby it followeth that howe much the more any doth aſpire to righteouſnes without Chriſt, ſo much the more is he remoued from true righteouſnes: and is the more depely drowned into the bottome of blindnes and curſe, and doth make him ſelf giltie of the bloud of Chriſt. Thoſe groſſe ſinnes are truely of litle weight, if they be compared with this ſinne, which teacheth that we may obteine righteouſnes by workes, and after the decree of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth frame and ordeine a worſhipping of God. For by this meanes is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte innocent bloud of Chriſt diſhonoured and blaſphemed.</p>
                  <p>The Gentiles did much more grieuouſly ſinne in worſhipping the Sunne and Moone (which they counted to be the true worſhipping of God,) than in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting other ſinnes which they doubted not to be haynous.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore the righteouſnes of man without Chriſt is nothing but blaſphemie, and the moſt haynous ſinne that man can committe. Therfore he that deſireth the grace of God by any other thing than by the bloud of Chriſt, let him neuer come into the ſight of god. For he doth nothing els but more and more, through his own righteouſnes, offend the maieſtye of God. And by thys may be gathered that men do moſt deteſtable erre, and the farther depart from Chriſt, which without Chriſt will leane and truſt to the authoritye of the fathers, or to olde cuſtome.</p>

                  <p>Where Chriſt did ſaye that the maner and knowledge of the worſhipping of God was knowen to the Iewes, he had more reſpecte to the law and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, than to the common people of the Iewes, becauſe the temple was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected at Hieruſalem, and god worſhipped there, not by the arbitrement of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by the preſcripte of the lawe. Therfore Chriſt doth ſay that the Iewes did not erre in obſeruing that lawe.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the progenitours, that is, the graundmother and mother of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie and ſuch like (of whom Saint Paule ſpeaketh) there is no doubte, but God had ſome remnaunt in that people, in whom true pietie did alwaies remaine.

                  <p>Therfore where Peter condemneth the inſtitution and traditions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers, he doth ſeperate them from Chriſt, which onely and alone is the ſoule, lyfe, and truth of the lawe. Wherupon we may conclude, that the papiſtes do moſt foliſhlye erre, which thinke that the bare name of the fathers and theyr traditions, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for them to defend al ſuperſtitions, and that by this truſt they might reiect whatſoeuer was brought out of the word of God.

And thys tyme the Prophetes, Apoſtles, and Chriſt him ſelf did call the laſte houre. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, it is called the laſte tyme in reſpecte of viſions and prophecyes, which were to be fulfilled of Chriſt. It is called (I ſaye) the laſte tyme, not that ſtreight way from the aſcention of Chriſt the laſte day ſhould come: but becauſe after thys preaching of the Goſpell, which than was, and now is, none other preaching is to come, nor to be looked for, nor that the matter of Gods grace myght be more reuealed and made more manifeſt, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is now reuealed &amp; ſhewed ſince the aſcenſion of Chriſt. Before this, one reuelation euer followed another. Whereupon the Lorde ſayd in Exodus:<note place="margin">24. Adonai.</note> 
                     <hi>Nomen meum Adonai non reuelaui eis.</hi> I dyd not reueale my name <hi>Adonai</hi> vnto them. For although the Patriarches knewe God: yet they had not ſo manifeſt a preaching and knowledge of God, as was afterward geuen by Moſes and the Prophets. But now there cannot be a more noble &amp; manifeſte preaching of the Goſpel, than is had in the world ſince the aſcenſion of Chriſt. And in that reſpecte Peter doth call this time the laſte tyme, becauſe there can neuer be a more clerer preaching of the Goſpel, than now is: It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propter vos qui per eum creditis.</hi> For your ſakes which by his meanes doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in God. For your ſakes (ſaith Peter) is the Goſpell preached.

                  <p>He gaue vnto him (I ſaye) this glorye, that our faith and hope ſhoulde be in God, and not in mere man, that is, that we ſhoulde beleue and truſt in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt both God and man is he, whom God gaue foorth as a propitiatour for ſynne by fayth in his bloud, to the declaration of righteouſnes in thys tyme.

                     <hi>Vt fidem et ſpem veſtram in deum habeatis.</hi> That you may beleue and truſt in God. Peter here doth ſay, that Chriſt was raiſed from death, that faith and hope might haue a firme and ſure ſtay, wherunto they might leane.

For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Chriſt had neuer ryſen againe, God notwithſtanding doth remaine in heauen. But Peter denieth that we cannot beleue in hym, vnleſſe Chriſt had ryſen agayne.</p>
                  <p>It is euident therfore, that fayth ought to behold and conſider another thing, then the bare maieſty of God. For it is the property of fayth,<note place="margin">Phil. 3 Cap. 4.</note> to flee and pearce in to heauen, that he might ther finde the father. And how can he doo that, except he haue Chriſt his guide and leader?

                  <p>Becauſe therefore our ſaluation is conſtitute and ſet in the reſurrection of Chriſt, and his high impery and rule, faith and hope found ther how to ſtaye and vphold them ſelues. For except Chriſt by riſing again had triumphed ouer death, and had borne the chiefe rule to defend vs with his might and power, what would haue bene done vnto vs, in ſo great a power of our enemies, and among ſo many violent aſſaults? Let vs learne therefore, to what ſcope and marke we ought to
<pb facs="tcp:7195:403"/> tende and ſhoote, which is, that we beleue and truſt in God, but in and by Chriſt, riſyng agayne from death. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Animas veſtras caſtificantes in obedientia veritatis.</hi> Seing your ſoules are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in obeyng the truth, through the ſpirite, to loue brotherly without fayning, loue one another with a pure hart feruently. We haue heard hitherto how Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exhorteth vs. Firſt that we gird vp the loynes of our mindes, that we myght walke ſincerely in the fayth. Secondly, becauſe this thing did coſt him ſo muche, that we ſhould liue in feare, not putting anye confidence in this, becauſe we are called Chriſtians: foraſmuch as God is ſuch a iudge, which reſpecteth no man, not one more then another. And now at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt Peter goeth forward to make an end of this firſt chapter, ſaying, purifying your ſoules in obeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſprit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Gala. 5.</note>Sainct Paule to the Galathians rehearſeth the fruites which do follow fayth, ſaying: The fruites of the ſpirite are charitie, ioye, peace, long ſuffring, gentlenes, goodnes, fayth, meekenes, temperancie. So alſo doth S. Peter here teach which are the fruites of fayth, that is, that we doe purifie our ſelues by obeying the truth in the ſpirite. For wher true faith is, it ſubdueth the body vnto it, and reſtrayneth the luſt and concupiſcence of the fleſh. And although it doth not vtterly deſtroy it, yet it maketh the body ſubiect to the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Saint Paule meaneth the ſame, when he ſpeaketh of the fruites of the ſpirite. It is a great labour to ſubdue the body vnto the ſpirite, and to repres the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and euil luſtes, graffed in vs by nature. For it is not poſſible for vs to liue well wythout grace.</p>
                  <p>Why doth he ſay: Purify your ſoules, rather then your bodies? Saint Peter did know that our carnall luſtes (yea although we be baptiſed) cannot be extincte before we be dead. Now it is not inough that a man do refrain him ſelfe from the act, and be onely outwardly pure, hauing an hart burning with euill luſtes: but we muſt ſhoot at this marcke, that our ſoules may be ſo purified, that the clenſing therof may come from the hart, and that the ſoule may be an enemy vnto euil lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, and continually fight with them, vntil it be deliuered.</p>
                  <p>Saint Peter addeth here very aptly, that we ought to purify our ſelues, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the truth through the ſpirite.</p>
                  <p>Many thinges are ſpoken of chaſtity, &amp; many be bookes written of the ſame. They haue taught to extinguiſh the carnal luſtes of the fleſhe by long faſtinges, abſtinence from fleſh and wyne.</p>
                  <p>Which thinges (although they ſomewhat helpe to that ende) yet they are not ſufficient to extinguiſh the ſayd luſtes and deſires.</p>
                  <p>Saint Hierome writeth of him ſelfe, that he did ſo puniſh his bodye, &amp; brought it ſo low, that he was like to an Ethiopian or blacke Moore. Notwithſtanding he did not ſo much preuaile by it. For he often times dreamed in his ſleepe, that he was preſent in the company of the faire damoſels at Rome. And ſaint Bernarde (as I ſaid before) did puniſh his body with ſo great abſtinence, that he ſtanck, and no man could abide his preſence. They both wer marueilouſly tempted, &amp; thought them ſelues able to ouercome thoſe temptations, by thoſe externe thinges.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe thoſe remedies which they vſed, were but externe and outwarde, and not applied inwardly, wher the roote of temptacion did lye, they were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficient to extinguiſh the ill deſires and luſts of the minde. But Peter here ſheweth a true and effectual remedy for this miſchief: that is to ſay, the obeing of the truth thorow the ſpirit, which alſo is declared in many other places of the ſcripture. As in Eſay:<note place="margin">Eſay. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Fides erit cinctorium renum eius.</hi> Faith ſhall be the girdle of his raynes. This is the true plaiſter, with the which the raynes are girded vp. The euil which we would heale, is not outward in cloth and garment, but bred inwardlye, and is fierce in the bloud, in the fleſh, and in the vaynes.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore it is not the beſt way to endeuour to extinguiſhe theſe luſtes with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7195:403"/> thinges onely, and to debilitate and weaken the bodye with faſtings and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for that is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt and chiefeſt way, although they ſomwhat helpe to that end, but it is fayth which can extinguiſh and reſtraine them, that they maye geue place to the ſpirite.</p>
                  <p>So the Prophet Zacharie ſpeaketh of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyne which Chriſt doth offer to drink, wherof virgens are gendered and begotten. Other kindes of wine are wonte to kindle euill luſtes, but thys wine, that is the Goſpel, reſtrayneth thoſe luſtes, and maketh the hart pure.</p>
                  <p>And this is it which Peter ſayth: when truth is receaued in hart, and obedience geuen to it in ſpirit, that is the moſt preſent remedie and beſt cure of all euil luſtes and deſires. For when the Goſpell entreth into the hart, immediatlye all euill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do ceaſe and geue place.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, the meaning of Peter is this: If ye wil remaine chaſte and pure, it behoueth you to embrace the obedience of truth, that is to ſay: It is neceſſarye for you not onely to read and to heare the word of God, but alſo to embrace it in hart.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore it is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the Goſpel be preached or heard once or twiſe, but ye muſt cleaue vnto it, and followe it continually.<note place="margin">29. Fruite hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred fold.</note> For the worde of God hath this grace, that the oftener ye handle it, and vſe it, the ſweter it waxeth, and ſhall bring forth <hi>fructu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> centeſimum tempore ſuo,</hi> fruite an hundred fold in his tyme. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In fraternitatis amore, qui ſit abſ<expan>

                        </expan> fuco:</hi> To loue brotherlye without fayning. For what end ought we to liue this chaſte and pure life? To obteyne eternall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes by it? No truely, but to this end, that we ſerue &amp; be profitable to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. What ſhall we do to repreſſe ſinne? Forſoth we muſte embrace fayth of the word of God. Now we doe reſtraine our ſinnes to profit other men, for when we bridle the body and fleſhe by the ſpirite, than we maye be ſome vſe and profite vnto our neighbours. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simplici ex corde diligite attentius. &amp;c.</hi> Loue one another with a pure hart fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentlye. In theſe wordes Peter doth very elegantly deſcribe &amp; expreſſe the partes and nature of true loue.<note place="margin">30. Loue.</note> The ſame obedience of which we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſayth Peter) draweth after it loue, not all maner of loue, but that loue which commeth from the minde and hart, wherwith we do vehemently and earneſtly, and not fainedly loue our brother and neighbour. True frendſhip loueth no colours,<note place="margin">31. Flattery.</note> true frendſhip hath learned no flatterie. Therfore ſayth Peter loue one another with a pure hart, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently, readie to beſtowe all that you haue for your neighbours ſake. Charitie, which is poured into the hartes of the faythfull, knoweth not a double or diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hart. Therefore Chriſt ſayth: <hi>Eſtote ſimplices ſicut columbae.</hi> Be ye ſimple as Doues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Loue one another with a pure hart feruentlie.</hi> The Apoſtles Peter and Paule do ſeparate and deuyde a ſunder brotherly loue and common loue. By brotherlye loue chriſtians ought to be as brethren, and to make no difference betwene them ſelues, for we haue all in common, one Chriſt, one baptiſme, one fayth, &amp; one trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I can not be in this reſpecte of greater price, than thou art, that which thou haſte, I haue, and am as riche as thou art, the ſame treaſure is vnto vs both: ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that peraduenture thou doeſt receaue it more worthelye than I do: as if thou ſhouldeſt lay it vp in golde, and I in ſome courſe cloth. Therfore as we haue grace and all the ſpirituall goods of Chriſt common: ſo ought we to haue, (if nede ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) our bodyes, our life, our goods, our dignities and offices common, that we may ſerue and do good to one another in all thinges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Loue one another with a pure hart feruentlye.</hi> Peter doth ſignificantlie here ſaye with a pure hart. And thys worde <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, whiche ſignifieth without diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, is often vſed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles. And for this cauſe vndoubtedly, becauſe they ſaw before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chriſtians would cal them ſelues brothers, but falſly &amp; hipocriticallie.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7195:404"/>
                  <p>Ther were many fraternities erected in the world, which were nothing els but mere lies &amp; deceits, excogitate of the diuel, &amp; ſo brought into the world, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vtterly were contrary vnto faith &amp; ſincere loue.<note place="margin">32. Sainte Fraunces</note> For why ſhould not Chriſt be aſwel mine, as ſaint Bernardes and his fraternity? Why ſhould not Chriſt be as wel thine, as ſaint Fraunces &amp; his fraternity? Therfore when any doo ſaye: I ſhal go to heauen, if I be in this fraternity, or in that fraternity: Anſwer thou him that he vttereth nothing but blaſphemies &amp; lies. For Chriſt can ſuffer none other fraternity but common, and ſuch as we al ought to haue among our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>I would not haue you ſo to take me, as though I condemne all Fraternities. For thoſe fraternities may be ſuffered, wher ther be aſſemblies gathered together for ſome treaſure, wherby the neceſſities of the poore and of the ſicke maye bee ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained and relieued.<note place="margin">33. Brotherne</note> But theſe fraternities are not ſuche, that by them the ſoules may peculiarly be the more holy: but they are onely or maye be permitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, &amp; for neceſſaries of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore &amp; nedy, as al our hoſpitals co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ar.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeake of brotherly loue, al Chriſtians haue one fraternity, which they obtained in baptiſme. Of the which fraternity no man (be he neuer ſo holye) hath more then either I or thou haſt. For with what price he was redeemed, with the ſame waſt thou redemed, and God beſtowed no leſſe for my cauſe, or for thy cauſe, then for the greateſt ſaynt in heauen, ſauing that he peraduenture had a more firme and ſtrong faith, then eyther thou or I.</p>
                  <p>Now common loue is a litle more large, then brotherly loue. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon loue pertaineth vnto the enemies, and ſpecially againſt them which are not worthye of loue. For as faith doth exerciſe, &amp; ſetteth forth her woorke, wher ſhe ſeeth nothing: ſo loue ought to ſee nothing,<note place="margin">34. Vnworthy</note> and to practiſe her worke ther, where nothing appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be loued. As Chriſt loued vs, when we wer in all reſpectes vtterly vnworthy of hys loue. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Renati non ex ſemine incorruptibile. &amp;c.</hi> Being borne of new, and not of mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tal ſeede, but of immortal by the word of God, who loueth and endureth for euer. All theſe thinges (ſaith Peter) ye ought to doo, becauſe ye are not the ſame nowe, which you were before, but you be borne a new, and made new men. This thyng was not brought to paſſe by your owne woorkes and meanes, but ther needed a new birth. For thou canſt not make a new man by thy own worke, but he muſt be begotten and borne. What Carpenter can by his own arte and cunning make a tree, which muſt grow out of the earth of his own accord? Therfore, as we are not made, but born the children of Adam, and drew ſyn of our Parents: ſo we can not be by our owne induſtry the children of God, but muſt be regenerate and borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne ſuche.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle Peter meaneth thus: Foraſmuch as you are made a new creature, it behoueth alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you behaue your ſelues otherwiſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you did before, &amp; that you purpoſe to leade a new life. As you liued before in hatred, ſo liue you now in loue. As you liued before in fleſhly luſts, ſo lyue you now in purenes &amp; clearnes of life. Let all be turned vpſide downe. But how chaunceth or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth this new natiuitie and byrth? Not of mortall ſede (ſaith Peter) but of immortal, by the word of God, who liueth here for euer: that is, we are borne againe of a certaine ſeede, as we ſee all other things to ſpringe and grow of ſede. If therfore that old natiuitie ſprange and came of ſeede, it behoueth alſo the newe byrth to be of ſome ſeede. But what a ſeede is that? Truly, neither fleſh nor bloud, nor none other corruptible thing, but the eternal word of God, that is, the whole, wherby we lyue, whereby we are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and ſpeciallye whereby we are regenerate. But after what manner is this wont to be done? By this God ſendeth forth his woord, that is, the Goſpell, which ſeede he throweth into the hart of man. If that ſede abide in the hart, the holy goſt is preſent, and frameth, and maketh a new man, which is farre other then he was before. He hath other thoughtes, other words, &amp; other workes. And by this meanes is he wholy chaunged: whatſoeuer he fled before, that he now ſeeketh, whatſoeuer
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7195:404"/> he ſought before, that he now fleeth. And this ſeede of the ſpirite cannot be chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it remaineth for euer, and changeth vs in to it ſelfe. Therefore, this maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous natiuity and birth is of an excellent ſeede. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quia omnis caro vt faenum. &amp;c.</hi> For al fleſh is as graſſe, and al the glory of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as the flower of graſſe. This place is taken out of the prophet Eſay,<note place="margin">Eſay. 40.</note> wher it is ſaid to the prophet: <hi>Clama,</hi> cry thou. And to him demaunding what he ſhould cry, it was ſayde agayne: <hi>ita clames,</hi> cry thus: <hi>omnis caro gramen eſt. &amp;c.</hi> All fleſhe is graſſe, and al the graſſe therof is as the floure of the fielde. The graſſe wythereth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> floure fadeth, but the word of our God ſhal ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>faſt for euer. The prophet Eſay &amp; Peter the apoſtle do meane no more but this. The fleſh of man is no more but cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption &amp; death. All things ar fading, brittle &amp; frayle. As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gras (flouriſh it neuer ſo pleaſauntly) the beuty therof immediately withereth &amp; periſheth: ſo what ſoeuer flouriſheth in man, whether it be in age or in beuty, in riches or anye ſuche like, in ſhort time it waxeth old, it falleth away, and periſheth.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet Eſaie with this ſentence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes being captiue in Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bilon, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring Babilon, the kingdome therof, the riches &amp; the felicitie, vnto graſſe floriſhing and freſhe: whoſe flower and beauty ſtreight way falleth awaye. And he willeth the Iewes to vnderſtand and that the councell and decree of the Lorde, which promiſed them deliueraunce &amp; returne into Hieruſalem, is eternall and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But Babilon to fal away as the graſſe, &amp; the flower of the graſſe, is an elegant and goodly preſident and ſpectacle of the miſerie and frailtie of man.</p>
                  <p>Here is to be noted that fleſhe profiteth nothing, when we neede to be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. By the name of fleſh I vnderſtand all the glory therof, as riches, pleaſures, wiſedome, and what ſoeuer ſeemeth excellent and noble in mortall thynges. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verbum autem domini manet in aeternum:</hi> But the worde of the Lorde endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for euer. The fleſhe paſſeth away, the fleſh with al her impurity corrupteth, and is corrupted: but the word of God remaineth for euer. That is to ſay, all theſe thinges which we haue ſpoken of in this whole chapter, as faith, pacience and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, are according to the word of God: they ſhal remain for euer.<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> For as Chriſt ſaith in Mathew: <hi>Caelum et terra tranſibunt, verba autem mea non tranſibunt,</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth ſhal paſſe away, but my wordes ſhal not paſſe. Now Peter conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, ſaying: <hi>Hoc eſt autem verbum quod euangelizatum et vobis.</hi> It is the woorde that hath bene preached vnto you. As though he ſhould ſay, you nede not loke farre of to come to this word, ye haue it before your eyes, this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word which we prech vnto you. By thys worde ye may extinguiſhe and reſtrayne all euill deſires, you nede not to goe farre for it, do you onely this, embrace it when it is preached vnto you. For it is ſo nigh vnto you that you may heare it: as Moſes ſayth in Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie: <hi>Verbum quod tibi praecipio, non longe eſt a te, &amp;c.</hi> The commaundement which I commaunde thee this day, is not farre of. It is not in heauen,<note place="margin">Cap. 30.</note> that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, who ſhall go vp for vs into heauen, &amp; bring it vs, &amp; cauſe vs to heare it, that we may do it? Neither is it beyond the ſea, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, who ſhal go ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea for vs &amp; bring it vs, and cauſe vs to heare it, that we may do it? But the word is very nere vnto thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thine hart for to do it.</p>
                  <p>The worde is ſoone preached and heard, but when it ſhall occupie &amp; enter into thine hart, it cannot againe die &amp; peryſh, nor wil ſuffer thee to die, but wil preſerue thee as long as thou dooſt ſticke and cleaue vnto it. As for example: when I heare that Ieſus Chriſt died, bare my ſinnes, and deſerued heauen for me, &amp; alſo hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me what goodnes ſo euer he him ſelfe hath: when this (I ſay) is preached, than I heare the Goſpell, than I heare the worde. This woorde when it is preached, the ſounde therof paſſeth away. But if thou receaue it in thine hart, and embrace it by fayth, it can not fall away. No creature is able to ſuppreſſe this truth. The pitte of hell can preuaile nothing againſt it: yea if I ſhould ſticke in the very iawes of the
<pb facs="tcp:7195:405"/> deuill, yet if I could apprehend and take holde of this word by fayth, I muſt nedes be deliuered and remaine ſafe where thys word doth abide. Therfore Peter ſayth not without cauſe, there is none other word to be looked for, beſide that which we haue preached vnto you. To this maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which Paul writeth to the Romaines: <hi>non pudet me euangelij, virtus enim dei eſt in ſalutem omni credenti.</hi> I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the Goſpell, for it is the power of God to ſaue all that do beleue.</p>
                  <p>This word is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuine &amp; eternall power. For although the ſound, voyce &amp; talke therof forthwith vaniſheth away, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pith, the truth, the knowledge which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in the voyce, abideth. As for example: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou putteſt to thy mouth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which wine is conteyned, thou drinkeſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wine, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup remaineth: ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word which is brought by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voyce, deſcendeth into the hart, (the voice vaniſhing away:) therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word is rightly called <hi>diuina virtus,</hi> the power of God, yea God himſelf: for ſo God ſpake to Moſes in Exodus.<note place="margin">Exod. 4. Iohn. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Ego ero in ore tuo.</hi> I will be in thy mouth.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſayth in Iohn. <hi>Ego ſum via, veritas et vita.</hi> I am the way, truth and lyfe. He that cleaueth vnto this word, is borne of God. Therfore that ſede by the which we are borne agayne, is our Lord God himſelf, and hys worde.</p>
                  <p>This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tenor &amp; ſumme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole firſt chapter. Now I do think it expedient to geue you an <hi>Epilogus</hi> or ſhort recapitulation,<note place="margin">35. Epilogius.</note> of all that Peter hath ſpoken in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>Peter hath ſpoken here of fayth, pacience, of ſanctimonie and holynes, of pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; regeneration. The ſumme of all theſe is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, that is, Chriſt preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. He is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſumme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Goſpell preached for your ſaluation. That is to ſay.

                  <p>After this Peter doth ſhew how God reuealed this grace vnto the Prophets, ſignifying when theſe thinges ſhould be, that is, when Chriſt ſhoulde come, what he ſhould ſuffer, and how he ſhould be gloryfied.</p>
                  <p>This done, Peter doth ſhew how Chriſt waſhed vs with his bloud, &amp; gaue hys ſpirit to incite &amp; ſtirre vs to embrace theſe myſteries, that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie borne agayne, &amp; that ſhe ſhould be conſtant in aduerſitie by fayth &amp; hope: that we ſhould obey y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, &amp; loue one another brotherly without feining: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we ſhould liue euerlaſtingly with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which we are born again to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God. And thus haue you heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde of Peter in this firſt chapter.</p>
                  <p>I intended (if it had pleaſed God to ſuffer me to remaine in this office &amp; place) to haue entred at my next co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſcourſing of the ſecond chapter, &amp; ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to haue gone through the whole epiſtle.

                     <p>The ſentence is this <hi>Alioquin quid facient ii qui baptiſantur pro mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis? ſi omnino mortui non reſurgunt, cur baptiſantur pro mortuis?</hi>

                     <p>There be diuerſe and ſondrie interpretations howe any are baptiſed for the dead. Chriſoſtome ſayth, that the Marcionites did accuſtome, when any of their cathecumines died without baptiſme, to put one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bed, and when they came to the dead corps, they aſked whether he would be baptiſed. Then he whiche laye vnder anſwered that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired baptiſme. And ſo the dead corps was baptiſed. Vvhen the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites for this matter were reprehended, they defended them ſelues by this place of Paule.</p>
                     <p>This maner of doing and worke was truely very ſuperſtitiouſe and rather to be counted a ſtage playe then a chriſtian rite. Nor the Apoſtle Paule doth make his argument as though he woulde ratifie and allowe this doing, but doth ſhew only that theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (although they wer not very well inſtructed of baptiſme) did feare the ſtate of the dead. And in his name did geue the ſacrament vnto an other, that the dead perſone ſhuld not be made fruſtrat of the reſurrection. And ſo by this their owne facte Paule vrgeth them to graunte the reſurrection of the dead.</p>
                     <p>Sainct Ambroſe, willing to declare that the faith of other men maye ſomtime be praiſed, and not their fact to be proued, bringeth the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Iephte. Vvho although he did not well in ſlaying and ſacrificyng his daughter, yet his fayth and conſtancie is praiſed in the epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues. But this ſayinge of Ambroſe is not to be embraced nor allowed. For, we ought not to do ill, that good may come therof: nor euill deedes oght to be excuſed by any good inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as they cal it, nor euils ar to be prai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed, although they may ſeme to be don by a ſincere faith &amp; a good minde. Iephte in dede is praiſed in the epiſtle to the Hebrues, but it is not ther expreſsed, that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for ſlaying &amp; ſacrificing his daughter. For, ther wer many things faithfully and luckely done of him in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of the Iſraelits. Ther be other men, whom this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pleaſeth not, neither they do thinke that this rite, which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionits afterward vſed, was obſerued of the Corinthians in Pauls time. For the Apoſtle would not haue refrained to haue taxed and touched ſo great an abuſe of ſo worthy a Sacrament. But how ſo euer it be, this fond opinion, to be baptiſed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, hath old and auncient authors &amp; defenders of the ſame. For Tertullian when he intreated of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the bodie, made mention of this ſurrogat baptiſme, and doth ſo interprete this place, that he would deduce his argument out of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of baptiſing. Yet he doth not affirme that Paule doth allow this rite, maner, and ordinance.</p>
                     <p>Sainct Ambroſe and Chriſoſtome do conſent vnto Tertullian. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7195:408"/> Chriſoſtome confeſseth, (which is worthy to be noted) that it is an hereſie &amp; ſuperſtition that one ſhould receiue the Sacramentes for an other. But yet, euen at this daye it is allowed and taught in the popiſhe church, that they which be preſent at maſſe, neede not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, becauſe the prieſt doth receiue the ſacrament for all.</p>
                     <p>It is read in the life of S Benedict out of one of the dialoges of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, that Benedict commaunded the communion to be geuen to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Nunne which was dead, ſo that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate bread was brought vnto the dead corps. And although many of the ſcholemen do ſaye, that this bread or hoſt was not conſecrate, they haue not that out of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of ſainct Gregorie.</p>
                     <p>The Iewes (as it is reported) do laboure with the like madneſſe, which do circumciſe the bodies of their children being dead, if they dye before the eight daye without circumciſion, as thoughe the Sacramentes were magicall excantations, which do profitte (as they ſay) onely <hi>opere operato.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that one maye communicate or receiue the ſacrament for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is contrarie to the propertie of thoſe myſteries. For the holye ſcripture calleth them, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

It is not conuenient, that the miſteries be in one parte, and the ſeale ſet in an other parte. Let this bee a ſimilitude, or example: Be it that a kynges or Prince doth graunte greate priuileges and large giftes to anye man by letters patentes: I praye you, where ſhal the ſeale be ſet? In the paper or parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where the grauntes are written, or els in an other peece of parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or paper? Truely, it ought to be put to the ſame. In like maner muſt we iudge, that he whiche beleueth, which is regenerate and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porat vnto Chriſt, ought to receiue the conſignations and ſeales of thoſe giftes by himſelfe, and not by his vicar or ſurrogate.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond maner of interpretation of this place of Paule is this: it chaunced oftentimes in the primatiue church, that they which laye at the point of death and were not baptiſed, deſired baptiſme.</p>
                     <p>Saint Ciprian maketh mention of this maner and rite. He was conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether they which were in the extremes of death (when they could not well be thorougly baptiſed or dipped, but were onely ſprinkled with water) were to be counted to be of the nomber of them that were baptiſed? He anſwereth, that they were baptiſed: and doth perſuade &amp; counſell the grace of baptiſme not to be denied vnto them. And in this ſenſe the interpretation of Pauls words is this: Vvhat do they which ar baptiſed for the dead? that is, which when the laſt houre commeth are

                        <pb facs="tcp:7195:410"/> rather to be counted to be of the nomber of the dead, then of the liuing.</p>
                     <p>Sainte Auſtine in the booke of his Confeſsions maketh mention of the geuing of baptiſme after this maner: where it is written that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain frind of his was chriſtened in ſuch extremitie of life, that when he was waſhed, he felte nothing, but when he was ſomwhat recouered, they declared vnto him what was don about him.</p>
                     <p>Saint Auſtin himſelfe being ſomtime greued with great ſickneſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be baptiſed. Nor he leaueth vntouched the abuſe of his time, in the which many of a ſet purpoſe did deferre their baptiſme, leaſte if they ſhould ſinne after they had receiued it, theyr ſins ſhould haue ben more greuouſe, and puniſhed with greater and ſharper paines. Therfore when any of the Catechumines did offend, if any man had rebuked him, it was ſaid for his excuſe: let him alone, he is not yet baptiſed. Vvhich thing ſainct Auſtin refelleth after this maner: There is as much (ſaith he) as if any man ſhould be greuouſly wounded, and ſhould perchaunce receiue an other wound, and they that ſawe this ſhould ſay: It maketh no matter, or it ſkilleth not, for he is not yet healed of his olde wound.</p>
                     <p>The third interpretation of theſe wordes of Paul is that, which doth affirme Paule to ſpeake here of true and lawfull baptiſme, and not of the ſuperſtitious baptiſing. Vve are all baptiſed for the dead, when we conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

For if this article be ouerthrowen, all the miſteries of our faith do periſh, and are nothinge worth. Therfore, expreſse mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this article is required in baptiſme. In the church of Aquilege, when the profeſſion of the faith was made, and the ſymbole rehearſed, and when they came to this clauſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the fleſh, it was expreſly ſaid and openly ſpoken: <hi>I beleue the reſurrection of this fleſh.</hi> Furthermore, the auncient fathers ordeined, that ſolemne baptiſme ſhould be celebrat and had in the time of Eaſter. Alſo, the words of Paule to the Romains do manifeſtly ſhew, that this ſacrament of Baptiſme reſpecteth the reſurrection of the dead, when it is ſayde: do you not know, that as many as be baptiſed in Chriſt Ieſu, are baptiſed to die with him? that as he roſe from death by the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the father: ſo we might likewiſe walke in newneſse of life? &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, the adminiſtration of the Symbole and outward ſigne, declareth the ſame. For they which are baptiſed, are dipped in water, and riſe from thence again, that death and reſurrection from the dead might by it be declared.</p>
                     <p>Theophilacte vnderſtandeth, <hi>to be baptiſed for the dead,</hi> to be nothing els, but to be baptiſed in this faith and belief, that our corrupt

Lib. 7. ca. 16</note> That is to ſay: At the beginning it pleaſed the prieſtes, that as it were in a theater the whole congregation bearing witnes, ſinnes ſhould be made manifeſt. Lo here he ſaith, it pleaſed the prieſtes. He addeth alſo, that ther was a priest appointed, to whom they which had ſinned, did come to confeſſe their ſinnes, and to heare and learne their penaunce, that is, what they
<pb facs="tcp:7195:417"/> ſhould do, or what puniſhment they ſhould ſuffer. And a litle after the ſame Sozomenus ſheweth the vſe of the Romiſhe Church in putting to penaunce.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, he ſaith that in the church of Conſtantinople, ther was a Prieſt appointed to heare the confeſsion of the repentaunts, vntil a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine noble woman, for the ſinnes ſhe had confeſſed, being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded of the Priest to faſt and to pray, and therfore abode in the Church: was found to haue committed fornication with a Deacon. For the which fact the Prieſts were then ill reported of. But Nectarius the Biſhop being doubtful what puniſhment was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for that offence, depriued the Deacon from his function and office. And becauſe ſome men gaue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, that euery man might haue liberty (according to his conſcience) to come to the communion of the holy miſteries, the penitenciary prieſt was no longer ſuffered to remaine in that office.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it began to take rote &amp; place in time paſt, yet in the beginning it was free and not vſed. At the laſt it began to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded &amp; extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the biſhop of Rome, when the ſtate of the Church was most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, in the yeare of the Lord. <hi>1215.</hi> or ther about.

                        <p>One Hugo a learned writer of that time, ſaith: <hi>Audacter dico,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Lib. de. eccle. pta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te ligandi et ſoluendi.</note>

Theſe be the woordes of Hugo, ſpoken not ſo boldly as buſily, and more then true, except Gods word be falſe. This Hugo liued about the yeare of the Lord. <hi>1130.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Not long after followed him Petrus Lumbardus, commonly called the maſter of the ſentence, becauſe he gathered together the ſayings of the fathers, and made (as it were) an abridgement of their doctrine.</p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:7195:418"/>
                        <p>This man liued about the yeare of the Lord. <hi>1150.</hi> He in his booke of ſentences ſheweth firſt the authority of the fathers,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. diſt. 17 et. 18.</note> that confeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made to God onely is ſufficient. Afterward, he bringeth in other ſentences tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching the contrary. Laſt of all, he himſelfe geuing ſentence, concludeth ſaying: <hi>Ex his indubitanter oſtenditur, oportere deo primum. &amp;c.</hi> bi this doubtles it followeth, that we must firſt offer our confeſsion to God, &amp; then to the prieſt. Otherwiſe, no man can enter into Paradiſe, if at the leaſt he haue oportunity and faculty ſo to confeſſe.</p>
                        <p>Gratianus the patcher together of the decrees, which liued in Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardus time, is more gentle and fauorable. For he doth define no certain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty, but bringing in ſentences <hi>pro et contra,</hi> for both partes, concludeth thus: <hi>Cui horum potius adhaerendum ſit, lectoris iudicio reſeruatur.</hi> To which of both theſe partes a man ought to leane and cleaue, it is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the iudgement of the Reader, that is, whether we ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe our ſinnes to God onely, or ells to God and to the prieſt alſo.

                     <p>The firſt is called <hi>mendacium iocoſum,</hi> a pleaſaunt or ſporting lye, as for example: when I ſay that I do lye, and other men do know that <hi>I</hi> doo lie, and therby do take ſome profit, or rather pleaſure. This kinde of lye (although it be no great ſinne) yet it hath very much leuity, which the Apoſtle reproueth in Chriſtians, as appeareth in the epiſtle to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.<note place="margin">Cap. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>I</hi> do not iudge that fables, parables, and fained narrations are to be referred to this kinde, which as the ſcripture in many places applieth to very weighty matters: ſo they haue in them much grace, neceſsitye, and profit. Saint Augustine doth not place ieſt in words among lies.</p>

                     <p>The midwiues of the Egiptians did ſaue a liue the newe borne male children of the Hebrues, which Pharao had commaunded to be ſlayne: and being accuſed before the king, of breking &amp; tranſgreſsing the law, they pretended by a dutiful and witty lie a certaine meruailous celeritie of bringing forth childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin they much excelled the Egiptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <p>Rahab the harlot by a wonderful lie did mocke the Citizens of Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, and by lying did ſaue the ſpies of the people of God.</p>

                     <p>Furthermore, the auncient diuines did diſpute whether thoſe whom we haue alledged haue ſinned or no, by lying and diſsimulation.</p>
                     <p>Origen with his folowers, did permit and ſuffer a good man to lye, ſo that it were profitable to them, for whoſe ſake it was done. And Saint Hierom is thought to fauour Origens iudgement. For he affirmeth that Peter and Paule did for the time diſſemble.<note place="margin">In epiſt. ad Gala.</note> But Saint Auſtine admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Hierome therof, denying that the ſcripture woulde admit anye maner of lie.

                     <p>Furthermore, other learned and godlye men do iudge Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine to ſpeake to ſiniſter lye and obſtinately against all kinde of lyes.

                     <p>This is alſo an other example of a duetyfull lye, when a Phiſicion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that a ſickeman, which is verye weake, is not greeued with ſo daungerous a diſeaſe, as he himſelfe imagineth, that therby he may put him in hope to recouer his health, and that he may the leſſe encreaſe hys ſickenſſe by taking thought.

                     <p>The third kinde of lie is called <hi>pernicioſum mendacium,</hi> a pernicious lye, becauſe it commeth out of an euill harte, and tendeth to the hurte of the neighbour which deſerued no harme. This kinde is vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned in all the ſcriptures, and her faulte increaſeth according to the greatnes of the detriment.

                     <p>To this kinde perteyneth hypocriſie, whiche our ſauiour Chriſt in the goſpell doth greatly rebuke.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE auncient fathers make mention of manye traditions. Firſt in the time of Tertullian this traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was vſed, that they ſhuld geue honie and milke to children, immediatly after their baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, <hi>vt</hi> (as he termeth it) <hi>infantarentur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the time of ſaincte Auguſtin and Ciprian this tradition was vſed, that the Euchariſtie, yea vnder both kinds, ſhould be geuen to infantes, as neceſſarie to ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>Epiphanius ſaith, that it was a tradition of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">In doct. com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pendiaria ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſus haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> that the fridaye ſhould be faſted, becauſe Chriſt ſuffered on a fridaye. Likewiſe, that the thurſdaye ſhould be faſted, becauſe Chriſt on that day was ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken vp into heauen, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was conuerſant in earth with his diſciples ſaid, that they ſhould not faſte ſo long as they had their bridgrome with them, but when the bridgrome ſhould be taken from them, then they ſhould faſt.</p>
                     <p>Epiphanius alſo in the ſame place writeth,<note place="margin">Aug. in epiſt ad Caſſolanu</note> and ſaint Auſten confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſame, that there was a tradition, not to faſte from Eaſter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pentecoſte.<note place="margin">Lib. de ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu ſancto.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was an other tradition (as Baſilius writeth) that betwene Eaſter and Pentecoſte God ſhould not be worſhipped with bowing the knee, which tradition was alſo obſerued on ſondayes. There was a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Apoſtles at Epheſus and in Aſia, that Eaſter ſhould be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized after the maner and cuſtome of the Iewes. In the churche of Rome the Apoſtolicall tradition was ſaid to be otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Therfore, foraſmuch as the traditions are ſo diuerſe, and do ſo much diſſent among them ſelues, they can not be the traditions of Paule or of the Apoſtles. For Paule ſaith, that in all places, and in euery Church he
<pb facs="tcp:7195:421"/> taughte one and the ſelfe ſame doctrine. Vvherupon Ciprian writeth, that he would not admitte any traditions, whiche are not founde in the goſpel, or in the actes and epiſtles of the Apoſtles. To the whiche <hi>I</hi> adde thoſe traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which are neceſsarily brought out of the ſacred ſcripture. Other traditions (what ſoeuer they be) are vncertaine, and not vſed in all places. VVherfore, if a iuſt conſent ought to be kept in the church, we muſt needes cleaue firmlie and conſtantlye to the ſcripture onely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> will bring one tradition more, by the whiche you maye knowe what all the reſidue are. Ireneus ſpeakynge of Chriſt ſayd: <hi>Non ergo multu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aberat a quinquaginta annis.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. cont. Va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lentinianos 2. cap. 40. Lib. 2. ca. 36.</note> 
                        <hi>Et ideo dicebant ei: Quinquaginta annorum nondum es, &amp; Abraham vidiſti?</hi> that is. He was not farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the age of <hi>.50.</hi> yeares. And therfore, they ſaide vnto him: Thou art not yet <hi>50.</hi> yeares olde, and haſt thou ſeene Abraham? And he confirmeth this his opinion by the Apoſtolicall tradition, ſaying: From fourtie or fiftie yere olde he grewe elder, in which age our Lorde taughte: as the goſpell and all the elders teſtifie, which came to Iohn the diſciple of the Lord, that Iohn declared the ſame vnto them. And our ſauiour Chriſt liued vnto Traianes time. Furthermore, ſome of the elders ſawe not only Iohn, but alſo the other Apoſtles, and hearde the ſame of them, and do beare witnes of this relation.</p>
                     <p>Theſe be Ireneus his words, which is of the nomber of the moſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers: But if we ſhould receaue and admitte that tradition, ther woulde enſue a meruailous confuſion (that I maye ſaye nothing els) of times alſo. For after that accompt, the Lorde Ieſus came almoſt to the age of <hi>.50.</hi> yeres (let vs graunt <hi>.48.</hi>) then it ſhall followe that he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>.18.</hi> yeres: when contrarie wiſe it appeareth plainly inough, that he beganne to preache about the <hi>.15.</hi> yere of the Empire of Tiberius. And in the <hi>.30.</hi> yere of his owne age. And they which do accompte the time of Chriſt thoroughly, folowe none other ſupputation. But accordyng to the Apoſtolicall tradition (after the relation of Ireneus) Chriſt ſhoulde haue died, riſen again, aſcended into heauen, and to haue ſent the holye ghoſt in the ſeuenth or eight yere of Claudius the Emperour. But the verie order and diſcourſe of the Euangelicall hiſtorie, and of the actes of the Apoſtles do repugne to that ſupputation. For in the time of Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Paule had much to do. In that time alſo a great and ſharpe famine troubled the whole worlde.</p>
                     <p>Therfore, the tradition which Ireneus recordeth, doth moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deceyue, and is vtterly falſe. VVho therfore, after this foule error of tradition perceiued, would beleue hereafter any traditions, yea be they reported to be neuer ſo auncient? It may be that this tradition was taken out of Papias. For as Papias did attribute muche to liuely tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7195:421"/> (wherwith he was meruailouſly delighted) ſo he had his folowers, Ireneus, Appollinarius, Lactantius, and certain other through the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of antiquitie in the error of the Millinaries. Of the which hereſie Papias (as ſome do write) laide the firſt foundation.</p>
                     <p>Euſebius that learned Biſhop doth not attribute much vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Papias, but ſayth in plaine wordes, that he wrote manye fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thinges,</p>

In the time of Manaſses ſincere doctrine, celebration of the ſacraments, were vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiled, and this defection continued vntil the time of Ioſias: yet there remained in the church ſome prophetes although they were few.

                     <p>So it is not to be doubted, but that God did reſerue ſome to be of his

In ſo much that our enemies neede not to imbraid vs, that this religion, which we now profeſſe, was not neither knowen nor profeſsed before the time of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Zuinglius.

                     </p>
                     <p>Concernynge the firſt, our high prieſt is called <hi>Chriſtus,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth in latine <hi>vnctus,</hi> annointed. For God the father hath annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with the holy ghoſt and all power. In him dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the godhead corporally. Again, the prophet Dauid ſaith: <hi>vnxit te deus, deus tuus oleo laetitiae prae conſortibus tuis.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 2. pſal,</note> God thy God hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted thee with the oile of gladnes aboue thy felows. Of the fulnes of this ointment all haue taken. For the ointment from the head of the high prieſt Chriſt, did not onely deſcende into his bearde, that is, vnto his Apoſtles and diſciples, which being very nigh vnto Chriſt, were ioyned vnto him as his bearde: but alſo into the ſkirtes of his garmente, that is, into the extreme and miſerablie membres of his faithfull flocke. By this ointment are vnderſtand all the giftes of grace, as of mercie, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and liberalitie.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore by this name Chriſt, that is, annointed, is ſignified both the natures of Christ, that is, the humane and the diuine nature, that Chriſte as true and verye man did receiue the vnction, and as God did geue the ointment.</p>
                     <p>Finally the high prieſt of the old Teſtament was onely man, but Christ was both God and man.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the ſecond, the dignitie of the perſon of Chriſt doth farre excel the prieſt of the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in the faithful interceſsion for vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the father. For Paule ſaith <hi>Chriſtus aſsiſtens,</hi> Chriſt aſsiſting, that is, being at the right hande of God the father, doth not onely make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs, but alſo ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding &amp; aſsiſting, doth offer &amp; exhibit his help vnto vs, when we haue fallen and be in daunger, as Iohn the Apoſtle ſaith in his epiſtle: Vve haue an aduocate with the father Ieſus Chriſt the righteouſe, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>Concernynge the third, the dignitie of the perſon of Chriſte is ſhewed to be far aboue the highe prieſt of the olde teſtament, in obteininge the ende whiche euerie man wiſheth for. And this is noted by this worde <hi>pontifex,</hi> whiche touching the etymologye of the worde doth ſignifie <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorem pontis,</hi> a bridge maker. And he that maketh the bridge, ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb facs="tcp:7195:426"/> at this marke, that the wayfaringe man maye paſse ouer the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from one bancke to an other. Now Chriſt is the onely mediatour betwene God and man: who ſaith: <hi>Nemo venit ad patrem, niſi per me.</hi> No man commeth to the father, but by me, <hi>I</hi> am the waye, <hi>I</hi> am the bridge, by whome onely ye may paſse through the bancke of miſerie, to the bancke of felicitie.</p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt again doth excell the high prieſt of the olde Teſtament in the dignitie of place. For the highe prieſte of the olde Teſtament went into a temple made with mans hande, but Christ our high prieſte entred into a temple not made with mans hande, that is, into heauen it ſelfe, which Paule calleth a greater tabernacle: partly, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued more then the earthly tabernacle, partly, becauſe it concerneth the greatnes of heauenly treaſures.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Chriſt doth excell the high priest of the olde Teſtament in a maner of mediatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, far more worthie then the rites and ceremonies of the olde Teſtament. For the prieſt of the olde Teſtament when he ſhould praye for the people, entred not into the inwarde tabernacle once for al, but euery yere once. Christ entred in once for all obteynyng redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and with one oblation made perfecte for euer them that are ſanctified. Therfore Christ our high priest is that lambe which was ſlayne from the beginning of the worlde which was verified in righteous Abel,<note place="margin">Lib. 22. ca. 15,</note> bearing a type of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the prieſt of the olde Testament entred into the tabernacle with the bloud of beastes as of goates, and of calues, and the bloud of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beasts. But Christ entred into the tabernacle with his owne bloud. Vvherupon the prophet Dauid ſaith:<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Holocauſtum pro peccato non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulaſti &amp;c.</hi> Thou requirest no burnt ſacrifice for ſinne. Then he ſayde: <hi>Ecce venio.</hi> Behold <hi>I</hi> come, that is to ſay: <hi>I</hi> will an oblation and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the ſinne of the worlde, which could by no means be purged and clenſed by the bloud of beaſtes.</p>
                     <p>Last of all the high prieſt of the old Testament did geue onely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and fraile thinges, and prayed only for temporall things to be put away. But Chriſt our high priest gaue eternall thinges which ſhal neuer fade nor fall away. The high priest of the old Testament made interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion onely for the nation of the Iewes. But Chriſt made interceſsion for the ſaluation of all mankind.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Chriſt had told the parable of the ſede vnto a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and had applied the ſame parable of the diuerſity of ſedes vnto the hearers of the Goſpell: He did at the laſt compare the ſede in the good ground, to him that heareth the woord, and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, which alſo beareth fruit, and bringeth forth ſome an hundreth fold, ſome ſixty fold, and ſome thirty fold.</p>
                     <p>Here may be a queſtion moued, what is ment by the diuers numbers of fruites, as a hundred, ſixty, and thirty.</p>
                     <p>Some of the old writers do expound this ſame diuerſly, and do wreſt and writhe it to a marueilous ſtraunge ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Some of them attribute a hundreth fold fruit to virginity,<note place="margin">In quaeſt. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelii. ca. 9</note> the ſixty fold fruit to widowhood, and to the maried perſons thirty fold. Of this opinion is ſaint Auguſtine.</p>
                     <p>Other do aſcribe an hundred fold to Martyrs, ſixty fold to Virgins, thirty fold to widowes, and to matrimony they attribute nothing. As though (to be maried) were to be counted that kinde of life which is not acceptable vnto God, but as a thing onely ſuffered by permiſsion, yea and ſome writers were not aſhamed to define <hi>(to be in wedlocke)</hi> is nothing els but to be in the fleſh, and to ſerue wantonnes. But what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is this (as ſaint Paul ſaith) but the very doctrine of diuels?</p>
                     <p>Theophilactus aſcribeth theſe fruits, the hundred fold to Anchorits, the ſixty fold to Monkes, &amp; the thirty fold to maried perſons. But this kind of interpretation, are not to aſsigne the fruits of the Goſpell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but to commend the ſtates of certain men, which are had in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. As though Chriſt here ſhould entreate of rewards to be geuen to
<pb facs="tcp:7195:427"/> them which embrace piety and godlines. But here is nothing leſſe ment then of rewardes to be receiued in the life to come: but of the fruits to be geuen in this life out of the word of God. Here is nothing ment what fruites of piety, virgins, widowes, maried men, Moonkes, or Heremites do bring forth, but how diuerſly the word of God bringeth foorth fruit in them that do beleue. It may be ſaid, that a faithfull maried man maye haue an hundreth fold, and the virgin none, and that he which liueth in the world, may haue an hundreth fold, and the Anchorite none.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Lib. 21. cap.

And of this minde were they which thought that no man ſhould be damned eternally, and which thought that the ſaintes wer ſo merciful, that they would not ſuffer ſo many thouſand ſoules to be damned, but that they would pray vnto God for them, that ſhould be damned: vnto the which ſaintes God cannot deny that which they require.

<pb facs="tcp:7195:431"/> But when the temptacion did not depart: going forth at the doores in a very ſharpe winter, he threw him ſelf naked into agreat heape of ſnow, and made of the ſnow ſeuen balles, which he ſetting before him, ſpake to his body after this maner: Behold (ſaith he) this greter balle is thy wife, other foure be thy children, two male, and two female: the other two be thy man ſeruaunt and maidſeruaunt.

                     <p>The other thing which is reported of him is this.

Two of the winges were erected aboue his head: he had two ſpred forth to flye, and with the other two he coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all his whole body. Fraunces at the ſight was marueilouſly astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and did both feare and reioyce. He feared to ſee the fearful faſtening to the croſſe. He reioyced that the Seraphin did ſo graciouſly and fauou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rablie looke vpon him. And when he had thought with him ſelfe a long time, what this viſion ment, at the last he ſaw a miracle that the like was neuer heard before. For there appeared in his own hands and feete (as it were) the token of faſtning of nayles. His right ſide appeared as though it had bene pearced with a ſpeare: and in his hands and fete ther appeared certaine long markes of hard and longe nailes. Vvhen this man of God ſaw this wonderfull ſight, and that God had indued him with ſuch a precious treaſure, he thought to conceale it from all men, rehearſing often times in his mouth this ſaying of the prophet: <hi>in corde meo abſcondi eloquia tua, vt non peccem tibi.</hi> I haue hidden thy wordes in my hart, that I may not ſinne vnto thee.

                     <p>He doth with an amplification exaggerate, that Chriſt died not for all maner of men: but for them which were vnworthie of all helpe and mercie.

And when men them ſelues would not gladly dye: by this it appeareth howe great the charitie of Chriſt was towarde vs, which woulde dye for vs that were weake, wicked ſinners, enemies, and vtterly vnworthy.</p>

That they which maye ſeme ſomtime to die for other (which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth very rarely) the thing being well conſidered and weighed, maye be counted for their own, &amp; not for an other mans cauſe, either for that they deſire ſome glorie therby, or els that they ſee them ſelues ſubiecte to all kinde of aduerſitie, which when they can not ſuffer, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die then liue. How much <hi>Decii, Curtii,</hi> and ſuch others did differ from the pure loue of Chriſt, it may be declared by many arguments.</p>
                     <p>First, they were not of the ſame dignitie and worthines that they might be compared with Christ. For the life which they loſt, was not of equal price. Furthermore (wil they nil they) they ſhuld haue once died &amp; peraduenture at that time when their hoſt was vanquiſhed and ſlaine
<pb facs="tcp:7195:433"/> of their enemies, and death hangyng ouer a mans head, which can not be auoided, maketh man the bolder to die, which is reported of Solon. For he when he was called to beare weapon againſt Pyſiſtratus the tyrant, beinge demaunded with what boldnes he onely durſte attempte this ſo bolde a dede, beſide other, anſwered: <hi>ſenectute,</hi> by mine age. For when he ſawe that he was not like to liue longe, he eaſilye perſuaded him ſelfe to put him ſelf in aduenture to die for his countrie.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſt, when he was in no point ſubiecte or giltie to death, and purpoſed to die for our ſake, he declared a much more great loue toward vs, than they had to their countrie. They died for their wiues, for their children, for the lawes of their countrie: But Chriſt would be ſlaine and die for vs beinge weake, for vs, being ſinners, for vs being enemies, for vs in all reſpectes being vtterly vnworthie. They by their death ſought their glorie and praiſe, and were had in admiration of all men. But Chriſt ſuſteined a death moſt reprochefull and infamous. In ſo muche that he was nombred and counted among theues and murtherers: Vvhen notwithſtandyng he was the moſt innocent of all other.</p>
                     <p>Finally, they in their death had no reſpecte of God: but whatſoeuer Chriſt did, he did it by obedience to the eternal God his father.</p>
                     <p>Therfore, we, if we reſpecte other, our owne ſelues, or Chriſt which ſuffred, we can finde none other cauſe of his death, but the mere loue of God toward vs. For we were ſo miſerable, ſo vtterly loſt, and ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, that we could be no merite of ours allure God to loue vs. For we were neither iuſt nor good. But it came I ſay onely of the mere loue and mercie of God through Chriſt to vs.</p>
                     <p>This particle, <hi>ſecundum tempus,</hi> at his time maye be referred to the death of Chriſt, which happened not at all tymes, but at that certaine tyme whiche was preſcribed and appointed of God. Therfore ſainct Paule ſayth that chriſt was geuen, when the fulnes of time was come.</p>

                  <p>The meanyng of theſe wordes: <hi>Ego &amp; pater vnum ſumus,</hi> I and the father are one, is this: I the ſonne an other perſon different from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the father, or the perſonne of the father, beinge an other perſon different from mine, are one, that is, are one eſſence, one power, one equalitie, one God, one vertue.</p>

                  <p>Vve muſt not thinke theſe words to be ſpoken in ſuch a ſenſe, as the water is read, to be made wine. For the water was made wine in ſuch maner, that it ceaſsed to be water, and ther remained onely wine. But here the worde was not ſo made fleſhie, that the worde, that is, God
<pb facs="tcp:7195:435"/> ceaſed to be God, and ther was nothing els but fleſh. God forbid. For it cannot be, that God was chaunged into man, and left to be God. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſubſtaunce of the word admitteth neither chaunge, nor end, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is immutable and infinite. Againe, neither the fleſh of Chriſt leauing his own proper nature was chaunged into the word, God forbid, this alſo. For if it ſhould be ſo, as Chriſt ſhould be on the one ſide depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his diuinity: ſo on the other ſide he ſhould be bireft of his true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might not be true man, nor truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued, nor truly borne, nor truly haue ſuffred and died, and therfore not to haue truly riſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therfore ſtedfaſtly beleue, that God being made man, tooke vnto him that which he was not, and loſt not that which he was. Vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this article of our faith, two thinges are chiefly to be beleued the one, that two are ſo vnited and knit together in Chriſt, that one and the ſame Chriſt is true God, and true man. The ſecond is, that the vnitye of the perſons letteth not, but that the natures may be diſtinct &amp; ſeperat, ſo that the diuinity may retaine and keepe that which is proper vnto it, and the humanity likewiſe may reſerue that which belongeth vnto it. If we hold wel theſe two pointes, we ſhal eaſily refel all errours, which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than by his members hath brought into the church, of the diuinitye and humanity of Chriſt. For Neſtorius, Eutiches, Seruetus, and the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſtes haue done no ſmal deſpite vnto Chriſt, when ſome of them went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to depriue Chriſt of his humanity, and other ſome went about to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>priue him of his diuinity.</p>
                  <p>Chriſoſtome writeth thus: <hi>Quum audieris: verbum caro factum eſt, ne turberis. &amp;c.</hi> Vvhen thou ſhalt heare: The word was made fleſh, be not troubled: For he doth not conuert the ſubſtance into fleſh (for it is a wicked thing ſo to vnderſtand it) but abiding that which he is, tooke vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruaunt. For, becauſe ther are ſome which ſay that the wordes of Incarnation are (as it were) dreames and phantaſies confounding their blaſphemye, he did put this particle <hi>factum eſt,</hi> not meaning to repreſent and ſhew forth the chaunging of the ſubſtaunce, but the aſſumption and taking on him true fleſh.</p>
